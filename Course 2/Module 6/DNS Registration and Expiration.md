-   **DNS** is a global system managed in a tiered hierarchy with **ICANN** at the top level.
-   Domain names must be globally unique for the system to work.
-   **Registrars** are organizations responsible for assigning individual domain names to other organizations or individuals.
-   Originally, there were only a few registrars, such as Network Solutions Inc., which was responsible for the registration of almost all domains that weren't country-specific.
-   With the growth of the internet, other companies were allowed to sell domain names.
-   Today, there are hundreds of registrars all over the world.
-   Registering a domain name involves creating an account with the registrar, searching for an available domain name, agreeing on a price and length of registration.
-   Once you own the domain name, you can either have the registrar's name servers act as the authoritative name servers for the domain, or you can configure your own servers to be authoritative.
-   Domain names can also be transferred from one party or registrar to another.
-   The recipient registrar generates a unique string of characters to prove ownership and approval of the transfer.
-   Domain name registrations only exist for a fixed amount of time and must be renewed to avoid expiration and loss of ownership.
