-   **Cloud computing** is a technological approach where **computing resources are provisioned** in a shareable way so that lots of users get what they need when they need it.
-   It is an approach that leans heavily on the idea that companies provide services for each other using these shared resources.
-  **Hardware virtualization** is a **core concept** of how Cloud computing technologies work.
-   It allows the concept of a **physical machine** and a **logical machine** to be abstracted away from each other.
-   With **virtualization**, a single physical machine called a host could run many individual virtual instances called guests.
-   A **hypervisor** is a piece of software that runs and manages **virtual machines** while also offering these guests a **virtual operating platform** that's indistinguishable from actual hardware.
-   The Cloud takes this concept one step further by building a **huge cluster** of interconnected machines that can all function as hosts for lots of virtual guests, which allows you to share resources among all of those instances.
-   Cloud computing companies can charge you to host virtual instances of your servers instead of you buying the physical machines, which could cost much less.
-   The Cloud computing company that can host your virtualized instances also offer dozens of other services.
-   **Public Cloud** is a large cluster of machines run by another company.
-   A **Private Cloud** is entirely used by a single large corporation and generally physically hosted on its premises.
-   A **Hybrid Cloud** describes situations where companies might run their most sensitive proprietary technologies on a Private Cloud while entrusting their less sensitive servers to a Public Cloud.
-   The Cloud is a new model in computing where large clusters of machines let us use the total resources available in a better way.
