-   **IP addresses** are 32-bit long numbers made up of **four octets**.
-   Each octet is described in decimal numbers, with 8 bits of data or a single octet representing decimal numbers 0-255.
-   IP addresses are distributed in large sections to organizations and companies, making them more hierarchical and easier to store data about than physical addresses.
-   IP addresses belong to networks, not devices attached to those networks.
-   **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** is a technology used to automatically assign IP addresses to new devices, while static IP addresses must be configured manually.
-   **Static IP addresses** are generally reserved for servers and network devices, while dynamic IP addresses are for clients, but there are exceptions.
-   IP addresses are more scalable than MAC addresses and allow for communication over larger distances.
