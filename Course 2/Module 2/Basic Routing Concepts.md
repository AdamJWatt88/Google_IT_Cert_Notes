-  The internet is an impressive technological achievement that allows communication and access to data from almost anywhere in the world.
-   Routing is the process by which communications happen across different networks, and it involves forwarding traffic depending on the destination address of that traffic.
-   A router is a network device that forwards traffic between two or more networks based on the destination IP of the packet. It has at least two network interfaces.
-   Basic routing involves just a few steps: (1) a router receives a packet of data on one of its interfaces, (2) the router examines the destination IP of this packet, (3) the router looks up the destination network of this IP in its routing table, (4) the router forwards that out through the interface that's closest to the remote network as determined by additional info within the routing table.![[basic-routing.png]]
-   Routing tables contain information about the various networks a router is connected to, as well as the preferred paths for forwarding traffic.
-   The Request for comments RFC system is a set of technical documents that define various standards and protocols for the internet. It has played a crucial role in shaping the internet into what it is today.
-   Routing protocols are used to automate the process of exchanging routing information between routers in a network. Some examples include OSPF, BGP, and RIP.
-   Non-routable address space refers to IP address ranges that are reserved for private use and cannot be routed on the internet. Examples include 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.
-   Troubleshooting networking issues often requires a solid understanding of routing, as well as other networking concepts.
