-   **Subnetting** is the process of dividing a large network into smaller **subnetworks** or **subnets**
-   Subnetting is necessary to break down large networks into smaller ones with their own **gateway routers**
-   **Address classes** allow us to break the total global IP space into discrete networks
-   **Core routers** on the Internet use address classes to route messages to the gateway router responsible for the network by looking at the **network ID**
-   A gateway router serves as the entry and exit path to a certain network
-   Subnets allow us to split large networks into many smaller ones, each with their own gateway router serving as the ingress and egress point for each subnet
-   **Subnet masks** extend what's possible with just network and host IDs
-   **CIDR** allows for even more flexibility than plain subnetting
-   Basic binary math techniques are used in subnetting
-   Incorrect subnetting setups are a common problem in IT support.
