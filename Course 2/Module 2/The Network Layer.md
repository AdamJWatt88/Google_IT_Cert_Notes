-   **Local Area Networks (LAN)** use MAC addresses to enable communication between nodes.
-   MAC addressing is effective on a small scale as switches can learn MAC addresses and transmit data efficiently.
-   MAC addressing does not scale well because every network interface on the planet has a unique MAC address that is not systematically ordered, making it difficult to communicate across distances.
-   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** is introduced later in the lesson to show how nodes learn about each other's physical addresses.
-   The network layer and Internet Protocol (IP) provide another solution to MAC addressing limitations.
-   IP addresses are used to enable communication over larger distances.
-   By the end of the lesson, students will be able to identify IP addresses, describe how IP datagrams are encapsulated in the payload of an Ethernet frame, and identify and describe fields in an IP datagram header.
