-   Binary numbers are based on the use of two numerals, 0 and 1, which make up the binary or base 2 number system.
-   The basic arithmetic for counting, adding or subtracting binary numbers is the same as for decimal numbers.
-   All numbers are universal, and different number systems represent numbers in different ways.
-   Decimal is the most common number system, based on 10 numerals (0-9), which are used to represent all whole numbers.
-   The binary number system is based on the constraints of how logic gates work inside a processor and is easier for computers to use.
-   Counting in binary is the same as in decimal, except with only two numerals.
-   A certain number of bits can represent a certain number of decimal numbers. An 8-bit number can represent 256 decimal numbers (0-255), and a 16-bit number can represent 65,536 numbers.
-   Addition is an important operator in computing and is simpler in binary than in other number systems.
-   The OR and AND operators are also important in computing and use 1 as true and 0 as false.
-   A subnet mask is a way for a computer to use AND operators to determine which part of an IP address is used to represent the network and which part represents the host.
