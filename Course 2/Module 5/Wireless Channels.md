-   **Channels** are smaller sections of the overall frequency band used by a wireless network.
-   They help address **collision domains,** which are network segments where one computer can interrupt another, leading to collisions.
-   **Collisions** occur when two or more **transmissions overlap**, causing all devices in question to stop their transmissions and wait a random amount of time before trying again.
-   The problem caused by collision domains has been mostly reduced on wired networks through devices called switches, but wireless networking doesn't have physical interfaces for a wireless device to connect to.
-   Wireless devices are doomed to talk over each other, but **channels help fix this problem** to a certain extent.
-   Different countries and regions have different regulatory committees for what radio frequencies might be used for what, so exactly how many channels are available for use depends on where in the world you are.
-   For example, in an 802.11 B network, channel 1 operates at 24 12 megahertz, but since the channel width is 22 megahertz, the signal really lives on the frequencies between 2.401 megahertz and 2.423 megahertz.
-   **Some channels overlap,** but some are far enough apart so they won't interfere with each other at all.
-  **Channels 1, 6 and 11** are the only channels to reliably not overlap![[wireless-channels-1-6-11.png]]
-   Most wireless networking equipment is built to auto sense what channels are most congested and dynamically change their channel as needed, but heavy channel congestion can still occur in dense urban areas with lots of wireless networks in close proximity.
-   Understanding how these channels overlap for all of the 802.11 specifications is a way to troubleshoot bad wireless connectivity problems or slowdowns in the network and optimize wireless network deployments.
-   It's not important to memorize all of the individual numbers, but to understand how collision domains are a necessary problem with all wireless networks and how to avoid them by ensuring that both your own access points and those of neighboring businesses overlap channels as little as possible.
