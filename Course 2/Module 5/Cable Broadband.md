-   Telephone and computer networking started with wired communication, but now wireless communication is becoming more common.
-   Television broadcasting started with wireless transmissions, but cable television technologies were developed in the late 1940s to provide television access to remote areas. The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 caused a boom in growth and adoption of cable television infrastructure.
-   Cable providers realized they could use **coaxial cables**, used for **cable television delivery**, to transmit data for high-speed internet access.
-   **Cable internet access** is generally a **shared bandwidth technology**, meaning many users share a certain amount of bandwidth until transmissions reach the ISP's core network.
-   Cable internet connections are usually managed by a **cable modem**, which connects a consumer's network to the **cable modem termination system (CMTS)** that connects lots of different cable connections to an ISP's core network.
