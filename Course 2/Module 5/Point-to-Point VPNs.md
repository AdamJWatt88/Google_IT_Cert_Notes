-   **Point-to-point VPNs** are a popular alternative to WAN technologies.
-   WAN technologies are great for transporting large amounts of data across multiple sites, but can be expensive.
-   Companies have been moving more of their internal services into the cloud, which has made high-speed connections between sites less necessary.
-   Cloud solutions allow companies to outsource infrastructure to other companies.
-   Point-to-point VPNs, also known as **site-to-site VPNs**, establish a VPN tunnel between two sites.
-   **VPN tunneling** logic is handled by network devices at either side, so users don't need to establish their own connections.
