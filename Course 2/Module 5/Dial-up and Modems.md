-   Computer networks were needed as computer use grew in the 20th century to allow for data sharing between computers
-   Early networking technologies focused on connecting devices in close proximity
-   In the late 1970s, two Duke University graduate students realized the potential for using the public telephone network to connect computers over longer distances
-   They created Usenet, a precursor to dial-up networks
-   Dial-up connections use the **public telephone network (POTS)** for data transfer, with modems converting computer data into audible wavelengths that can be transmitted over the phone line
-   Early modems had low **baud rates** (measure of bits per second passed over a phone line), but this improved over time
-   Dial-up access to the internet became popular in the early 1990s, with speeds reaching 14.4 kilo bits per second
-   **Broadband** technologies have largely replaced dial-up, but it is still used in some rural areas
-   Dial-up technology was a main way for computers to communicate over long distances for several decades
