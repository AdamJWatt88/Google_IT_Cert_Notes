-   Public telephone network used for Internet connectivity due to existing infrastructure
-   Dial-up connections used as main method of connecting to the Internet from home
-   Telephone companies saw potential to use same infrastructure for faster Internet access and developed DSL technology
-   DSL uses twisted pair copper and operates at a frequency range that doesn't interfere with phone calls to send more data than traditional dial-up
-   DSL technology uses **DSLAMs (digital subscriber line access multiplexers)** to establish long-running data connections across phone lines
-   Two common types of DSL: **ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line)** and **SDSL (symmetric digital subscriber line)**
-   **ADSL** has different speeds for outbound and incoming data, with faster download speeds and slower upload speeds, while SDSL has the same speeds for upload and download
-   **SDSL** was primarily used by businesses that hosted servers, but is now more common for both businesses and home users
-   Further developments in SDSL technology have yielded **HDSL (high bit-rate digital subscriber lines)** that offer speeds above **1.544 megabits per second**
-   There are many minor variations in DSL technology that offer different bandwidth options and operating distances, but it is best to contact the ISP for specific details.
