-   **T-carrier technologies** were invented by AT&T to allow many phone calls to travel across a single cable.
-   The first T-carrier specification was **Transmission System 1 (T1)**, which enabled up to **24 simultaneous phone calls** to be carried over a single twisted pair copper wire.
-   Each of the 24 phone channels could transmit data at **64 kilobits per second,** giving a T1 line a data transfer rate of **1.544 megabits per second**.
-   T1 technology was initially used to connect telecom company sites, but later became popular for providing faster internet connectivity for businesses in the 1990s.
-   Improvements were made to T1 lines by developing a way for multiple T1s to act as a single link, resulting in the **AT3 line **with a total throughput speed of **44.736 megabits per second**.
-   T-carrier technologies are still in use today, but have mostly been surpassed by other broadband technologies such as cable or fiber connections.
-   **Fiber technologies** have replaced older copper-based ones for inner ISP communications.
