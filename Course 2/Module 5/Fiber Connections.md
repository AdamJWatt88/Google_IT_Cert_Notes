-   The core of the Internet uses fiber for its connections due to higher speeds and longer transmission distances without degradation of the signal.
-   **Fiber connections** use light for data transmission instead of electrical currents, and can travel many miles without degradation compared to thousands of feet for copper cables.
-   Using fiber to deliver data closer to the end-user has become popular in recent years, with the term **FTTX (fiber to the x)** being developed to describe various implementations.
-   **FTTN (fiber to the neighborhood)** uses fiber technologies to deliver data to a single physical cabinet that serves a certain amount of the population, with twisted pair copper or coax used for the last distance.
-   **FTTB (fiber to the building)** is where fiber technologies are used for data delivery to an individual building, with twisted pair copper used to connect inside the building.
-   **FTTH (fiber to the home)** is used when fiber is run to each individual residence in a neighborhood or apartment building, and may also be referred to as **FTTP (fiber to the premises)**.
-   The demarcation point for fiber technologies is known as an **optical network terminator or ONT,** which converts data from protocols that the fiber network can understand to those that more traditional twisted pair copper networks can understand.
