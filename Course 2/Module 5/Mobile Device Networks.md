-   Mobile devices use various wireless networks to communicate with the internet and other devices, such as cellular networks, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and IoT protocols.
-   As an IT support specialist, troubleshooting networking or connectivity issues for end-users is a common task, which involves ensuring that the device is configured to connect to the correct network and checking whether the wireless radio has been disabled.
-   Mobile devices can have multiple network connections at the same time and will try to connect to the **most reliable** and **least expensive connection** available.
-   Wireless networking works by sending a radio signal between two antennas, and the signal strength **can be impacted** by **distance**, **interference**, and** the way the mobile device is held or worn**.
-   Short-range wireless networks, such as **Bluetooth**, are used to connect mobile devices to peripherals, and pairing devices involves exchanging information and sometimes entering a pin or password.
