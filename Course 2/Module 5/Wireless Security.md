-   Wired communication has inherent privacy as only two nodes on either end can know the transmitted data, while wireless transmission can be intercepted by anyone within range.
-   **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)** is an encryption technology that provides low-level privacy for wireless networks.
-   It's important to know that **the number of bits** in an encryption key corresponds to how **secure** it is. The **more bits** in a key the longer it takes for someone to crack the encryption
-   **WEP** only uses a **40-bit encryption key**, which can be easily cracked by modern computers in just a few minutes, making it less secure.
-   WEP was quickly replaced by **WPA (Wifi Protected Access)**, which uses a **128-bit key**, making it more difficult to crack than WEP.
-   **WPA2**, an update to WPA, is the most commonly used encryption algorithm for wireless networks, which uses a **256-bit key**, making it even harder to crack.
-   **MAC filtering** is another way to secure wireless networks, which only allows connections from trusted devices by configuring access points to recognize specific **MAC addresses**.
-   MAC filtering does not encrypt wireless traffic being sent through the air but provides an additional barrier against unauthorized devices connecting to the wireless network.
