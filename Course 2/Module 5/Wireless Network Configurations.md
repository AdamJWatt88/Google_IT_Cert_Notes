-   Three main ways to configure wireless networks: **Ad-hoc networks**, **Wireless LANs (WLANs)**, and **Mesh networks**.
-   **Ad-hoc networks**: Simplest type with no supporting network infrastructure. Devices communicate directly with each other within range and pass messages along. Used in smartphones, industrial or disaster relief settings.
-   **Wireless LANs (WLANs)**: Most common in the business world. Consists of one or more access points that act as bridges between wireless and wired networks. Wireless devices communicate with access points, which forward traffic to the gateway router to access resources outside the WLAN.
-   **Mesh networks**: Hybrid of ad-hoc and WLANs, with devices communicating wirelessly to form a mesh. Mostly made up of wireless access points and connected to a wired network. Allows deployment of more access points to increase performance and range of the network.
