-   As an IT support specialist at a small company, you set up a network using non-writable address space for internal IPs and a router configured to perform NAT.
-   You also set up a local DNS server and DHCP server for easier network configuration and signed a contract with an ISP for internet access.
-   To accommodate growth, you configure a VPN server to allow remote access and employees from all over the world to connect to the LAN.
-   As the company expands, a second office across the country requires access to the network, and WAN technologies come into play.
-   **WAN** stands for **Wide Area Network**, which spans across multiple physical locations and typically requires contracting a link across the Internet with an ISP.
-   The ISP handles sending data between the two sites via the local loop, which connects to the ISP's core network and the Internet at large.
-   WANs use different protocols at the data link layer to transport data between sites, which are also used at the core of the Internet.
