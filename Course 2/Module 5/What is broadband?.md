-   **Broadband** refers to any internet connectivity technology that isn't dial-up, and is usually faster and always on.
-   Broadband is important because it allowed the internet to reach its true potential for both businesses and home users.
-   Businesses were the first to adopt broadband technologies, using **T-carrier systems** to transmit data faster than dial-up.
-   The World Wide Web and its increasing complexity required ever increasing data transfer rates, making broadband necessary for home users.
-   Without broadband, the internet as we know it today wouldn't exist, and we wouldn't be able to stream music or movies, or easily share photos.
-   **T-carrier technologies** are expensive and mostly used by businesses, but other broadband solutions exist for both businesses and consumers.
