-   Cellular networking is a popular form of wireless networking, also known as mobile networking.
-   It is now common all over the world and in some places, it is the most common way of connecting to the Internet.
-   Cellular networks are similar to 802.11 networks, but there are many different cellular specifications.
-   Cellular networking operates over radio waves and specific frequency bands are reserved for cellular transmissions.
-   These frequencies can travel over longer distances more easily, usually over many kilometers or miles.
-   Cellular networks are built around the concept of cells, each assigned a specific frequency band for use.
-   Neighboring cells are set up to use bands that don't overlap, similar to the optimal setup for a WLAN with multiple access points.
-   Cell towers that broadcast and receive cellular transmissions can be thought of like access points, but with a much larger range.
-   Many devices use cellular networks for communication, including phones, tablets, some laptops, and high-end automobiles with built-in cellular access.
