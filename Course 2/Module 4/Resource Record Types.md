-   **DNS** operates with a set of defined resource record types that allow for different kinds of **DNS** resolutions to take place.
-   The most common resource record is an **A record**, which is used to point a domain name to a specific **IPv4 IP address**.
-   In its most basic use, a single **A record** is configured for a single domain name,Â but a single domain name can have multiple A records too.
-   **DNS round robin** is a technique used to balance traffic across multiple IPs. It involves iterating over a list of IPs in an orderly fashion.
-   A domain name can have multiple A records configured for it.
-   **A quad A record** is similar to an **A record** but returns an** IPv6 address** instead of an IPv4 address.
-   A **CNAME record** is used to redirect traffic from one domain to another. It is used to ensure you only have to change the canonical IP address of a server in one place.
-   The **MX record** is used to deliver email to the correct server, while the **SRV record** is used to define the location of various specific services.
-   The **TXT record** type was originally intended to be used only for associating some descriptive text with a domain name for human consumption.
