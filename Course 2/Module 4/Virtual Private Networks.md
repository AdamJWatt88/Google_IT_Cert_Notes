-   Businesses have many reasons to keep their network secure, such as protecting proprietary information and limiting access to network services.
-   Technologies like **firewalls**, **NAT**, and **non-routable address** space can help secure a network.
-   **Virtual private networks (VPNs)** are a common technology used by businesses to extend a private or local network to remote employees or sites.
-   VPNs create a **tunneling protocol** that allows a computer to access resources on a network as if it were physically connected.
-   When establishing a VPN connection, a virtual interface with a matching IP address is created on the user's computer.
-   VPNs encrypt the payload section of the **transport layer**, which contains an entire second set of packets, to carry data across the network.
-   VPNs require strict authentication procedures, including two-factor authentication.
-   VPNs can be used for site-to-site connectivity, allowing physically separated offices to act as one network and access resources across the tunnel.
-   There are many different implementations of VPNs, but the most important takeaway is that they use encrypted tunnels to allow remote computers or networks to act as if they're connected to a network that they're not physically connected to.
