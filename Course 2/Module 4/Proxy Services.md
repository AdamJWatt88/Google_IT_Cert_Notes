-   **Proxy service**: a server that acts on behalf of a client to access another service
-   **Proxies** provide additional benefits such as **anonymity**, **security**, **content filtering**, and **increased performance**
-   Proxies exist at almost every layer of the networking model
-   Examples of proxies include **gateway routers**, **web proxies**, and **reverse proxies**
-   Web proxies were used in the past for increased performance but are less common now due to faster connections and dynamic web content
-   Web proxies are commonly used today for content filtering to prevent access to certain sites
-   **Reverse proxies** act as a single front end for multiple servers living behind it to handle high traffic and perform load balancing and decryption
-   Proxies come in many other flavors and act as intermediaries between a client and another server.
