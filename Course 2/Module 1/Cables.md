- Most network cables used today can be split into two categories, copper and fiber. 
- Copper cables are the most common form of networking cable
- The sending device transmits binary data over copper wires by manipulating the voltage between two predetermined ranges. The receiving system is capable of interpreting these voltage changes as binary ones and zeros, which can subsequently be decoded into various data formats.
- The most common types of copper twisted pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables. These names are simply shorthand for category five or category six cables. Each category has distinct physical characteristics, such as the number of twists in the copper wire pairs, that affect the achievable transfer rates and usable lengths. Cat5 is an older standard that has been mostly supplanted by Cat5e and Cat6 cables.
- Cat5e cables have largely replaced older Cat5 cables because their internal structure is designed to minimize Crosstalk. Crosstalk is a phenomenon where an electrical pulse transmitted on one wire is inadvertently detected on another wire, causing the receiving end to be unable to interpret the data and leading to network errors. However, higher-level protocols have built-in mechanisms for detecting missing data and requesting re-transmission of the data.
- The higher-quality specifications of a Cat5e cable reduce the likelihood of data needing to be re-transmitted, resulting in more efficient data transfer over the same time period. Cat6 cables adhere to even more stringent standards to minimize Crosstalk, which makes them more expensive than Cat5e cables.
- Fiber cables use pulses of light to represent binary data.
- Fiber is expensive and fragile but can transport data over longer distances and with less potential data loss.
- Fiber is commonly used in computer data centers.
