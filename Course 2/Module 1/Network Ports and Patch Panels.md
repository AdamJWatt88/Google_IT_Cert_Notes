-   Final steps of physical layer occur at endpoints of network links
-   Twisted pair network cables terminated with RJ45 plug
-   RJ45 is most common plug specification for computer networking
-   Network ports are attached to devices that make up computer network
-   Switches have many network ports, servers and desktops usually have one or two
-   Network ports usually have two small LED lights: link and activity
-   Link light indicates properly connected devices with power on
-   Activity light flashes when data is actively transmitted across cable
-   Activity light does not correspond directly to ones and zeros anymore due to high network speeds
-   Switches may use same LED for link and activity status or indicate other things like link speed
-   Troubleshooting data available through port lights
-   Some network ports mounted in walls or underneath desks, connected to network via cables ran through walls to patch panel
-   Patch panel contains many network ports but does not perform any other work![[patch-panel.png]]
-   Additional cables ran from patch panel to switches or routers to provide network access to computers at other end of links
