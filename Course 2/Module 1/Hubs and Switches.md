-   Cables allow for point-to-point networking connections, but are not useful for networks with many devices.
-   Hubs are a physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers, but causes a lot of noise and collisions. Hubs are becoming obsolete for this reason.
-   Collision domains are network segments where only one device can communicate at a time.
-   Switches are a more sophisticated device than hubs and can inspect ethernet protocol data to send it only to the intended system, reducing collisions and increasing throughput.
-   Switches are on the data-link layer.
