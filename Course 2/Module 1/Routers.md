-   **Hubs** and switches connect computers on a LAN or Local Area Network.
-   **Routers** forward data between independent networks and operate at **layer three** or the **network layer**.
-   Routers can inspect IP data to determine where to send things.
-   Routers store internal tables containing information about how to route traffic between different networks.
-   Home and small office routers mainly forward traffic from inside the network to the ISP.
-   **Core ISP routers** form the backbone of the internet and handle much more traffic and complexity.
-   Routers share data with each other via a protocol known as **BGP** or **Border Gateway Protocol**. That lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic.
-   Core routers have many different connections to other routers and use **BGP** to learn about optimal paths for forwarding traffic.
-   Routers are global guides for getting traffic to the right places on the internet.
