-   The physical layer is complex and involves mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering principles
-   Its main focus is on moving ones and zeros from one end of the link to the next
-   Understanding the physical layer is important for troubleshooting networking issues and setting up new networks
-   The physical layer consists of devices and means of transmitting bits across computer networks
-   A bit is the smallest representation of data that a computer can understand and is a one or a zero
-   Ones and zeros are sent across networks through the physical layer
-   These ones and zeros make up the packets of data being sent
-   A standard copper network cable carries a constant electrical charge
-   Ones and zeros are sent acrossÂ those network cables through a process called **modulation**.
-   **Modulation** is a way of varying the voltage of the charge moving across the cable and is used to send ones and zeros
-   **Line coding** is a specific type of modulation used in computer networks
-   Modern networks can move 10 billion ones and zeros across a single network cable every second through line coding
