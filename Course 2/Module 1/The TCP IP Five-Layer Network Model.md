-   There are five layers in the networking model: **physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layer.**![[five-layer-network.png]]
-   The **physical layer** deals with physical devices and specifications for networking cables and connectors.
-   The **data link layer** is responsible for interpreting signals so devices can communicate and the most common protocol used is ethernet.
-   The **network layer** allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers and the most common protocol used is IP (internet protocol).
-   The **transport layer** sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to receive the data and the most common protocols used are **TCP (transmission control protocol)** and **UDP** (user datagram protocol).
-   The **application layer** has protocols that are application-specific, such as browsing the web or sending/receiving email.
-   Each layer has its own specific role, and together they enable data to be delivered from one device to another, similar to how different aspects of a package being delivered are handled by different layers.![[components-of-network-layers.png]]
