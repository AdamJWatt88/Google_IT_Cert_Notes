- **Firewalls** are network devices that block traffic based on certain criteria to keep a network secure.
- They can operate at different layers of the network, but are commonly used at the **transport layer**.
- Transport layer firewalls can block traffic to certain ports while allowing traffic to others.
- For example, a firewall can allow external access to a web server on port 80, but block access to a confidential file server on another port.
- Firewalls can be independent network devices or a program that can run anywhere, including on individual hosts.
- Major modern operating systems have built-in firewall functionality.
