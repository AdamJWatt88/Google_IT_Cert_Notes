- There are various network layer models, and some might combine layers or have more layers than others.
- The **OSI model** is the most rigorously defined and has **seven layers**.
- The OSI model introduces two additional layers between the **transport** and **application** layers.![[OSI-model.png]]
- The **fifth layer** in the **OSI model** is the **session layer**, which facilitates communication between **actual applications** and the **transport layer**.
- The **presentation layer** is responsible for ensuring that unencapsulated application layer data is understandable by the application in question, and it handles encryption or compression of data.
- In a **five-layer model**, all of these functions are lumped into the **application layer**.![[OSI-model-comared-to-5-layer-model.png]]
- Understanding the basics of the OSI model is important in networking education
