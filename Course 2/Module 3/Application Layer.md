- **Application layer** is the layer in the networking model that deals with how actual applications send and receive data.
- The **payload section** of **TCP** segments is the entire contents of whatever data applications want to send to each other.
- Many different protocols are used at the application layer, and they are numerous and diverse.
- There are standardized protocols across application types, which ensures interoperability.
- **HTTP** is the application layer protocol for web traffic.
- Web browsers and web servers have to communicate using the same HTTP protocol specification in order to ensure interoperability.
- Most other classes of applications also have standardized protocols that clients and servers have to communicate using in the same way.
