-   **Central authentication simplifies password management.**
-   Up to 25% of people forget their password at least once a day.
-   **Active Directory (AD) stores a one-way cryptographic hash of the password, not the password itself**.
-   Only one person should be able to authenticate with their account for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
-   As an IT support specialist, you may be authorized to reset passwords for users who forget them.
-   The **person requesting the password reset should prove that they are allowed to do so**, as per organization policies and procedures.
-   A **temporary password should be created**, and the **"user must change password at next login" option should be checked**.
-   **User accounts** can be **locked** by AD if someone enters the **wrong password too many times**, and **unlocking the account requires administrator authorization**.
-   If the user has used the **EFS feature to encrypt files,** **resetting their password can result in loss of access to those files**.
