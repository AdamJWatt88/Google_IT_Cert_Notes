-   Mobile Device Management (MDM) allows configuring policies for mobile devices
-   MDM profiles or policies contain settings for the device's operating system
-   MDM profiles can be used to pre-configure device settings to make things easier for end-users
-   MDM profiles can also enforce security settings like encryption and lock screen requirements
-   Remote wipe capability can be used to trigger a factory reset of a mobile device from the central MDM system, in case of theft or loss
-   MDM policies are specific to each mobile operating system (OS) and can be created and distributed using an Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) system
-   Enrolling a device in MDM involves signing into the EMM system and pushing MDM policies down to the device
-   A large number of EMM systems can manage MDM policies for Android, iOS, or both
