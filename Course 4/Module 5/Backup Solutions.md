-   Choosing between DIY backup system or cloud providers
-   On-site/self-managed backups: buy commercial NAS device, load with hard drives, send data over network
-   Drawbacks of on-site backups: limited disk capacity, handling failed hard disks, not the best long-term solution
-   Both on-site and off-site backups are recommended, if within budget
-   Backup time period impacts long-term storage needs and overall cost
-   Archiving older data using slower/cheaper storage mechanism, such as data tapes, balances cost with convenience
-   **Rsync**: command line utility for efficient file transfer and synchronization between locations or computers; commonly used as a backup tool
-   **Time Machine**: first-party backup solution for **Apple's Mac operating systems**; supports incremental backup, restoring entire system or individual files, and restoring older versions of backup files
-   **Backup and Restore**: first-party backup solution for **Microsoft**; file-based backup supports complete or incremental backups, system image backup supports differential mode
