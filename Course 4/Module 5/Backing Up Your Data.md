-   To protect organization from critical data loss, need to design a data backup and recovery plan
-   **First, identify what data needs to be backed up; only include data that's necessary for operations**
-   Consider total data currently owned and future growth when choosing a backup solution
-   **Data can be backed up on-site or off-site**
-   **On-site backups** are quicker to access, but vulnerable to physical disasters like fires
-  **Off-site backups** better prepare for catastrophic events but require transmitting data outside of network
-   **Encryption is crucial for backup data security**, both during transmission and storage at rest
