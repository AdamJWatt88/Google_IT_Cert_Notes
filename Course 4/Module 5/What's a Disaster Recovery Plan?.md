-   A **disaster recovery plan is important for IT support specialists** to be prepared for disastrous accidents or mistakes.
-   It includes documented procedures and plans on how to react and handle an emergency or disaster scenario from the operational perspective, including things that should be done before, during, and after a disaster.
-   The goal is to **minimize disruption** to business and IT operations by **keeping downtime of systems to a minimum and preventing significant data loss**.
-   **Preventive measures** include procedures or systems that proactively minimize the impact of a disaster, such as regular backups and redundant systems.
-   **Detection measures** are meant to alert the team that a disaster has occurred that can impact operations, such as environmental sensors or smoke detectors and fire alarms.
-   Corrective or recovery measures are those enacted after a disaster has occurred, such as restoring lost data from backups or rebuilding and re-configuring systems that were damaged.
-   **Redundant power supplies** and **environmental sensors** are examples of preventative measures, while smoke detectors and fire alarms are detection measures.
-   **People working in the building should also be considered**, and a plan should be in place to ensure that everyone is able to work effectively, **such as setting up temporary** accommodation in case of a building evacuation.
-   Work should begin on restoring full operations of everything affected after the disaster has been detected and steps have been taken to either prevent an outage or minimize downtime.
