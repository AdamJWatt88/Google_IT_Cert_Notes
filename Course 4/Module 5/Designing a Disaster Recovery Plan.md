-   No one-size-fits-all approach
-   **Three types of measures:** preventive, detection, corrective/recovery
-   Perform risk assessment to identify priorities
-   **Preventive measures**:
    -   Redundancy for critical systems
    -   Sound backup and recovery system
    -   Regular automated backups
    -   Clear and updated data recovery procedures
    -   Redundancies for power, communication, data links, and hardware
    -   Operational documentation for critical procedures
    -   Periodically verify that documented steps work
-   **Detection measures**:
    -   Comprehensive system to quickly detect and alert to service outages or abnormal environmental conditions
    -   Monitor critical infrastructure services and access
    -   Monitor for conditions that indicate a problem is likely to occur
    -   Test monitoring and reaction/response systems regularly
-   **Corrective/recovery measures**:
    -   Steps to restore normal operations and recover from incidents or outages
    -   Include documentation links for restoring various systems and data from backups
    -   Ensure critical documentation is accessible in an emergency or disaster scenario.
