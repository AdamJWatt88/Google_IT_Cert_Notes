-   Making mistakes is a part of being human, and learning from them is crucial.
-   **A post-mortem report is created after an incident or project to analyze what went well and what didn't, and to learn from mistakes**.
-   The purpose of a post-mortem is to **understand the root cause of mistakes** and prevent them from happening again, not to punish or shame anyone.
-   The report documents in **detail what happened leading up to, during, and after the event** or project.
-   **Sharing post-mortems** with other teams in an organization encourages a culture of learning from mistakes and helps identify areas for improvement.
-   If people are afraid to make mistakes, decision-making will be conservative and innovation will suffer.
-   **Embracing post-mortems fosters a healthy attitude towards mistakes** and encourages risk-taking and innovation.
