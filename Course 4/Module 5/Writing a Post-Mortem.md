-   A **typical post-mortem for an incident begins** with a **brief summary** that **includes** what the incident was, how long it lasted, what the impact was, and how it was fixed.
-   A **detailed timeline of key events is necessary**, including when it started, when people involved were notified or realized what was going on, and every action taken in an attempt to resolve the situation.
-   **A very detailed and honest account of the root cause is necessary**, explaining what led to the issue. The intent is not to blame but to learn from the experience.
-   **A more detailed explanation of the resolution and recovery efforts should be documented**, including the steps taken, rationale, reasoning, and outcome.
-   **Close out the report** with a list of specific actions that should be taken to avoid the same scenario from happening again, including improvements to monitoring systems and efforts aimed at improving response handling.
-  **Highlight things that went well** during the incident analysis, including fail-safe or fail-over systems that prevented a large outage or minimized the severity of the outage.
-  **Demonstrating the effectiveness of preventative systems is important** to justify their cost, and these examples make the benefits clear.
-   Learn from any mistakes, own them, and do better next time, both in IT and in life.
