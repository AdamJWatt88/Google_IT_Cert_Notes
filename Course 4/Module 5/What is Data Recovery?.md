-   Data recovery is the process of restoring lost or corrupted data after an unexpected event, such as physical damage, malicious actions, or malware.
-   The method of restoring lost data depends on the nature of the data loss and the presence of backups.
-   IT support specialists play an important role in ensuring that data is protected and available for business operations.
-   To **prepare for unexpected events**, a well-designed disaster plan and procedure is necessary, which includes regular backups of critical data such as customer data, system databases, system conflicts, and financial data.
-   A **post-mortem** is a way to document any problems encountered during a data recovery event and the steps taken to fix them to avoid future occurrences.
-   Being unprepared for a major data loss event can severely impact businesses.
