-   Cloud services can be hosted on data centers or remote servers
-   Different types of machines are used for different services
-   SaaS services are pre-configured and have limited options for customization
-   Cloud providers manage everything related to the service for SaaS solutions
-   **IaaS solutions** require users to decide on **infrastructure configuration, machine types, and storage needs**
-   Starting small with IaaS is a pro tip, then selecting more powerful instances as needed
-   Regions are geographical locations containing data centers
-   Each data center is called a zone and is independent of the others
-   **Public, private, and hybrid Clouds are different types of Cloud solutions**
-   **Public Cloud** services are provided by third-party providers to the public
-   **Private Clouds** are owned by the company and may be located on-site or in a remote data center
-   **Hybrid Clouds** are a mixture of both public and private Clouds
-   Integration is important for accessing, migrating, and managing data seamlessly in a hybrid Cloud solution.
