As a backup method, mobile synchronization allows an IT professional to move the user’s data seamlessly to a new device.

# Mobile synchronization for collaboration and productivity platforms

Mobile synchronization is essential to today’s collaboration and productivity platforms, such as Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. These are account-based platforms that allow the user to link familiar productivity software and apps to a particular user or company profile. This way one username and password connects the user to the files, photos, people, and content needed to sync across different instances of the software or app.

## Sync Microsoft 365 to a mobile device

To sync Microsoft 365 to a mobile device, the user needs to have a Microsoft account. With a Microsoft account, a user can set up Office apps and email on an iOS or Android mobile device. This setup process typically involves installing and setting up the Outlook mobile app for email, and the Office mobile app for other Microsoft tools, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The following link provides detailed guidance on how to set up these capabilities on a device:
