-   Cloud resources must consider regions - geographic location containing data centers
-   **Load balancer distributes queries to multiple VMs serving the same website**
-   **Autoscaling** increases or reduces capacity as needed
-   Local disks are ephemeral, separate storage resources needed for data persistence
-   VMs connected to databases running in the cloud, managed by cloud provider
