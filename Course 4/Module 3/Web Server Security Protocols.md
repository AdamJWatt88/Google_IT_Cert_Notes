-   Security is an important aspect of IT infrastructure services in all organizations.
-   Security protocols are put in place for various things like data encryption, authentication, etc.
-   **HTTPS** is the **secure** **version** of **HTTP** and ensures secure communication between the web browser and the website through encryption.
-   **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is the most popular protocol used to keep communication secure over a network and is widely used to keep web browsing secure.
-   **SSL (Secure Socket Layer)** is an older protocol used to secure communication between a web server and client but is now **deprecated** in favor of **TLS**.
-   To **enable TLS** on a server for a website, a **digital certificate of trust** is needed from a certificate authority, which verifies that the website is trustworthy.
-   Everyone should be thinking about security, and all layers of an organization's infrastructure should have a layer of security built upon them.
