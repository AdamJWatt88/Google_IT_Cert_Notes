-   Disasters can happen to any company, no matter how much planning is done
-   It's important to be prepared to recover from a disaster
-   One way to prepare is to routinely back up company data
-   Backups should be stored somewhere far away from the company's location
-   This is important in case a disaster destroys the company's building and backups are lost
-   Later in the course, methods for backing up data and recovering from disasters will be discussed
-   Being a sys admin responsible for keeping data available is challenging, but also rewarding
-   Learning the fundamentals of IT support builds the essay or sys admin skill set
