-   Always test changes before deploying and document the process
-   Invest time and effort based on risk involved
-   Assess risk by considering importance of service and number of users impacted if service went down
-   Mission-critical services are those without which company operations cannot function
-   Less critical services are those that can be worked around or do not affect operations as much
-   More users reached by service, more effort to ensure changes are not disruptive
-   User agreement about service availability can be used to establish priorities for maintenance
-   Prioritize fixing problems that prevent people from doing their work over minor annoyances
