-   As an IT support specialist, you will often be in charge of fixing problems
-   The problem could be in a user's computer, a server in your own infrastructure, a piece of code running in the Cloud or somewhere in between
-   **Before fixing the problem**, make sure you can **recreate the error** to test your solution and make sure the problem is gone after applying the fix
-   This is called a **reproduction case**, creating a roadmap to retrace the steps that led the user to an unexpected outcome
-   When looking for a **reproduction case,** answer **three questions:**
    -   What steps did you take to get to this point?
    -   What's the unexpected or bad result?
    -   What's the expected result?
-   Fix the underlying issue in your **test instance**, **never in production**
-   **Document all steps and findings**, it may prove invaluable in dealing with similar issues in the future
-   After applying the fix, **retrace the same steps** that led to the bad experience to verify the solution
