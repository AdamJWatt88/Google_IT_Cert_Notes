-   Sysadmins need to provide **updates** and **maintenance** for machines in a company to ensure they run the latest secure software.
-   It's not feasible to install updates immediately as they come in, so batch updates are done instead.
-   **Batch updates** mean updating **all servers** with the **latest security patches once every month** or so.
-   **During batch updates**, services may need to be **taken offline** to perform the **update and verify** that it works with the service.
-   Updates **don't have to be performed every time new software becomes available,** but it's **important** to routinely install the **latest security patches** to keep the system secure.
