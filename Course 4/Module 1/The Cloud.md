-   Responsibility for issues: No matter what method chosen, the **user is responsible** for any **problems that arise**.
-   **Misconceptions** about the Cloud: The Cloud is **not a magical entity** that disperses data in the form of raindrops. It is a **network of services** that store and process data.
-  **Cloud computing**: The ability to access data, applications, and files from anywhere in the world as long as there is an internet connection.
-   **Data centers**: Facilities that store servers and are used by companies with large amounts of data. Companies like Google and Facebook have their own data centers, while smaller companies typically rent out space in a data center.
-   **Advantages of the Cloud:** Eliminates the need for large amounts of storage space on personal devices, and allows for the use of internet services that handle hardware and software updates.
-   **Drawbacks of the Cloud:** Cost, as subscription fees can add up over time, and dependency on the service provider for data and productivity.
-   **Considerations when choosing a method**: Compare subscription costs against the long-term costs of maintaining personal hardware, and be aware of the responsibility for any issues that may arise.
