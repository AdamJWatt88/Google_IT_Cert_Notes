-   When having administrative rights, use them responsibly and avoid using them unnecessarily.
-   In **Linux**, use the **sudo command** to execute commands as an **administrator**.
-   Respect the privacy of others and do not access private information that you have no business accessing.
-   Think before you type, as actions taken with administrative rights can have significant consequences.
-  **Documenting** what you did is crucial when using administrator rights, and tools like `script` in Linux and `Start-Transcript` in Windows Powershell can be used to record commands.
-   With great power comes great responsibility, and it's essential to minimize the impact of any mistake by quickly reverting changes if something goes wrong.
-   Keep configuration in a **version control system** or document the steps needed to go back to the previous state in case of a rollback.
-   Some commands are easy to rollback than others, and it's crucial to think about what a rollback would look like before making changes and to have copies of any information that could be lost.
