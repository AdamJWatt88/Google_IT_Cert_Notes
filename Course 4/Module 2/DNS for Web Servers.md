-   **Web server** is used to **store** and **serve content** to clients that request services
-   **DNS** needs to be **set up** for clients to **access the website** by typing a URL
-   **Domain name** needs to be **purchased** from a **domain registrar** like Godaddy.com or BlueHost.com
-   **Website files** can be **stored** on a **cloud hosting provider** or on our own servers
-  **Domain registrars** can also provide **cloud hosting services for a fee**
-   Pros and cons of hosting a service yourself or offshoring it
-   If **hosting website files ourselves**, we need to **point the domain name** to where the **content is located**
-   **Two ways to do this**: using DNS settings from domain registrar or setting up an authoritative DNS server
-   It makes sense to have DNS servers that know the information since we own the domain name and host the web content ourselves.
