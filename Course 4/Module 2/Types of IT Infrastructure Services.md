-   IT infrastructure services keep a company running
-   A **single person** may be responsible for all services in a **smaller company**, while **teams** of **sysadmins** manage services in **larger companies**
-   **Physical infrastructure** includes setting up **servers** for services like **file storage**, either on site or at another location
-   **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** provides pre-configured virtual machines, **eliminating** the need for **managing hardware and updates**
-   Example of IaaS include:
	-   **Amazon EC2**
	-   **Linode**
	-   **Windows Azure**
	-  **Google Compute Engine**
-   Network setup includes setting up subnets, assigning IP addresses, configuring hardware, and providing wireless internet and DNS
-  **Networking as a Service (NaaS)** allows companies to outsource networking services, **eliminating the need for expensive hardware and network security management**
-   Software needed for business operations must be available to users, and can be maintained through **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
-   **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** provides an all-in-one solution for building and deploying web applications
-   Example of PaaS include:
	-   **Heroku**
	-   **Windows Azure**
	-   **Google App Engine**
-   Directory services centralize users and computers in one location, and can be deployed through **Directory as a Service (DaaS)** providers
-   Example of DaaS include: 
	-   **Windows Active Directory**
	-   **OpenLDAP**
-   Cloud services are a good option but it is important to understand how a service works and how to maintain it before employing cloud services
-   Cloud services have pros and cons, including recurring costs and dependence on the provider's service.
