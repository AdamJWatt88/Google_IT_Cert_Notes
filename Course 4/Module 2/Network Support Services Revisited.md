-   In an IT enterprise environment, there are network services used to improve productivity, privacy, and security
-  **Two common internal support services are Intranets and proxy servers**
-   An **Intranet** is an **internal network** accessible only to people on the company network
-   Intranets improve productivity by **providing a medium for sharing information**, like a **company website**
-  **Intranets** are most commonly seen in **large enterprises**
-   A **proxy server** acts as an **intermediary** between a company's network and the Internet
-   It **receives network traffic** and relays it to the company network, **keeping company network traffic private** from the Internet
-   The internet **only knows the proxy server** and **not the company network**
-   **Proxy servers** can also **monitor** and **log internal company network activity** and be configured to **filter certain website access**
-   **Proxy servers** provide **privacy and security** on the Internet and **regulate access** inside the company.
