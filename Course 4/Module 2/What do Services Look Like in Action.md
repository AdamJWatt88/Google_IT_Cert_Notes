-   IT support specialists need to understand how services operate to manage and troubleshoot them
-   **Services** such as DHCP, DNS, NTP and others run as **background processes**, also known as **daemons** or services
-   Each service has one or more **configuration files** that determine its behavior
-   Some services have **interactive interfaces** for configuration and inspection, while others rely on **system infrastructure** or **manual editing of configuration files**
-   It's important to know how to start and stop services and **check their logs for activity**
-   Services are usually **configured to start at boot** and restart if they crash, but this can be **changed if desired**
-   Each service may require specific knowledge for configuration, but the **general concepts for managing and configuring services are the same across different systems**
