-   **Virtualization** is the creation of a **virtual version** of a **physical resource** such as an **operating system, server, storage device, or network resources**.
-   It allows running **multiple operating systems** or **applications** on a **single physical machine**, which provides **better resource utilization, flexibility, and scalability**.
-   **Two ways** to run services: **Dedicated hardware** or **virtualized instance** on a server.
-   Running services on **dedicated hardware** provides **better performance** but is **expensive** and **less flexible**.
-   **Virtualizing servers** allows for **better resource utilization** and **cost efficiency** as **multiple services** can run on **one physical server**.
-   **Virtualized servers** are **easier to maintain** and **upgrade as services** can be **easily stopped or migrated** to other physical servers.
-   **Virtualization** also provides **redundancy** and **backup** options in case of **hardware failure**.
-   **Redundant physical servers** can also **provide backup** options but can be **costly**.
-   To make the right choice **between virtualized servers** and **dedicated hardware**, consider the **pros** and **cons** for your **company's needs**.
