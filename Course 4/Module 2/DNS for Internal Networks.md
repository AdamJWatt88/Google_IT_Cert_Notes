-   **Reasons for having own DNS servers:**
    1.  Map internal computers to IP addresses
    2.  Host website content ourselves
-   **Using a local host file to map IP addresses to host names manually**
-   Example of host file in **Linux**: `/etc/hosts`
-   **DNS query checks local host file first, then local DNS servers**
-   Setting up a local DNS server that contains all organization's computer names mapped to their IP addresses
-   Changing network settings for all computers to use this DNS server
-   Integrating DNS with directory service (e.g. Active Directory and LDAP) to automatically populate machine to IP address mappings
