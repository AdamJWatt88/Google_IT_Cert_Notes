-   In mobile operating systems like iOS and Android, users cannot see a list of running processes.
-   Instead, users manage mobile apps that are running on the OS.
-   When a mobile app is running, there will be one or more processes associated with it, but the details are managed by the OS.
-   As an IT support specialist, you may help end-users troubleshoot slow mobile devices and manage their mobile apps.
-   To check what apps are currently running on a device, open the app switcher in iOS or Android.
-   Suspended apps are paused but not closed, and the OS will try to keep apps suspended as much as possible to save battery power.
-   Misbehaving apps that keep working in the background or are frozen can slow down a device and use battery power.
-   Troubleshoot a misbehaving app by closing apps one at a time and seeing if there is one app in particular that slows the device down.
-   Closing a misbehaving app may be all you need to do to make your device run smoothly again.
-   Restarting the device may also fix performance issues.
-   Check battery usage of installed apps in the Settings app in iOS or Android to identify apps that are using the most battery power.
-   Learn which apps end-users need to know whether or not the battery use is unusual
