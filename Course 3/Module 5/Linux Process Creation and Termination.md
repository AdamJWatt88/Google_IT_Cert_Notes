-   In Linux, processes have a parent-child relationship where every process launched comes from another process
-   The initial process that starts when the computer boots up is called init, with a PID of one, which starts up other necessary processes
-   Processes generally terminate automatically when they complete their tasks
-   When a process terminates, it releases all resources it was using back to the kernel for other processes to use.
