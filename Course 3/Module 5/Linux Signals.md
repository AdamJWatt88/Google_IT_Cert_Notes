-   In Linux, we can send signals to processes.
-   **Signals in Linux** are labeled with names starting with **"sig"**.
-   We can use **"sig.int"** to interrupt a process, and the default action of the signal is to terminate the process.
-   We can send a **"sig.int"** signal through the keyboard combination **Control+C**.
-   To demonstrate, we start a program like `sudo parted`.
-   We interrupt the tool using the **Control+C** keyboard combination.
-   The process closes, and we're back in our shell.
