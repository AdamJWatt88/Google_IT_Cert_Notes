-   Process management tools are used to manipulate running processes on a system.
-   In Windows, we have seen **Task Manager**, **PowerShell's Get-Process commandlet**, and the **Task List utility** for managing processes.
-   **Process Explorer** is another process management tool that can be downloaded from Microsoft's website.
-   Process Explorer provides a view of currently active processes and a list of the files being used by each process.
-  **CTRL+F** allows you to search for a process in Process Explorer or you can click the magnifying glass.
-   The tool enables users to search for a specific process, and right-clicking on the process provides options to manage it, including **Q process**, **Q process tree**, **restart**, and **suspend**.
-   **Q process** terminates the selected process, **Q process tree** terminates the process and all its **descendants,** **restart** stops and starts the process again, and **suspend** temporarily stops a process and frees up the resources it was consuming.
-   The Process Explorer tool also provides monitoring information, which will be discussed in a future lesson.
