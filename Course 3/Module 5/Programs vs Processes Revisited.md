-   **Programs** are **applications** that we can run, while **processes** are **programs** that are **running**
-   A program can have multiple processes running at the same time
-   Processes take up **hardware resources** like **CPU** and **RAM**
-   Computers are powerful enough to handle day-to-day processes but sometimes a process can take up more resources than it's supposed to or become unresponsive, making the entire computer unresponsive
-   Understanding how processes work is important before managing them
-   When a process is launched, it's given a **process ID** to uniquely identify it
-   The **kernel** makes **decisions** about what **resources** to give to the process
-   Background processes run in the background and are necessary for the system to function
-   Background processes include scheduling **resources**, **logging**, **managing networks,** etc.
-   Users can view all the processes running on their system to see both visible and background processes.
