-   **Events** are **logged** on machines similar to how we jot down life events in a journal.
-   In **Windows**, events logged by the operating system are stored in an application called **The Event Viewer**.
-   **The Event Viewer** is a great tool for troubleshooting issues such as **computer game crashes** or **login/access problems**
-   You can launch the Event Viewer either from the **Start menu** or by typing in `eventvwr.msc` from the run box.
-   The **default view** of the **Event Viewer** shows a **summary of recent events**, but **custom views** allow you to **create filters** that show only the information you're interested in.
- **Windows logs** contain event logs that are generally applied to the **whole operating system**, while **application and services logs** track events from a **single application** or **operating system component**.
-   Each line in a given log in the Event Viewer represents an event, with **information grouped** in **columns** about the event.
-   The Event Viewer is a super helpful tool for IT support specialists and can provide detailed information about software or hardware issues.
-   **Custom views** and **filtering capabilities** can help manage the large amount of information in the Event Viewer.
