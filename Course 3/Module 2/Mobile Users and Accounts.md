## Notes 

-   Mobile operating systems handle user accounts differently than other OS because most mobile devices are used by a single person.
-   Examples of mobile devices that have user accounts in the OS include GPS units in vehicles, smartphones, and tablets running iOS or Android.
-   The primary account is the initial account used during device setup and is used to create a user profile for the device's user.
-   A user profile contains all user accounts, preferences, and apps, and can be synchronized to the cloud.
-   Additional accounts can be signed into a user profile, such as email or social media accounts, which can be used for single sign-on (SSO) with apps.
-   As an IT support specialist, never ask for someone's password and encourage them to change their password if revealed.
-   Most mobile devices only support one user profile, but some Android devices support multiple user profiles.
-   Mobile operating systems have ways to protect data, such as setting a device password, pin, or unlock pattern, using biometric data (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition), or using mobile device management (MDM) policies.
