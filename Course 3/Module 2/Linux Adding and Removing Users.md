-   To **add a new user in Linux**, use the `useradd` command, e.g. `sudo useradd juan`
-   This sets up basic configurations for the user and sets up a home directory
-   Verify that the user was created using the `ls /home` command
-   Combine the `useradd` command with `passwd` to make the user change their password on login
-   To remove a user, use the `userdel` command, e.g. `sudo userdel juan`
