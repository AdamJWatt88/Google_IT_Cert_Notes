-   Linux has **special permissions** to allow users to perform tasks that require **root privileges** **without** giving them full root access.
-   This is useful for commands that need to change files owned by root, such as the password command.
-   The special permission bit that enables files to be run with the permissions of the owner of the file is called **setuid**.
-   The **setuid** bit is denoted by an **S** in the permissions field and can be enabled symbolically with the S or numerically with a four.
-   Similar to setuid, files can also be run using **group permissions** with **setgid** or **set group-ID**.
-   The **setgid** bit is denoted by a capital **S** in the permissions field and can be enabled symbolically with the s or **numerically with a two**.
-   The **sticky bit** is another special permission bit that **allows anyone** to **write** to a file or folder **but** only the **owner** or **root can delete it**.
-   The sticky bit is denoted by a **T** in the permissions field and can be enabled **symbolically** with the **t** or **numerically** with a **one**.
-   These special permission bits are important for understanding **user access**, **group access**, **passwords**, and **permissions** in computer security.
-   While not commonly used in day-to-day tasks, it is essential to know about these special permission bits.
