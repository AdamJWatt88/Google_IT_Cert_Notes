-   There are **two command line interfaces (CLIs)** available on Windows: **cmd.exe (command prompt)** and **powershell.exe (PowerShell)**.
-   **PowerShell** supports most of the same commands as **command prompt**, and many more.
-   PowerShell commands that will be used are actually **aliases** for common commands in other shells.
-   An **alias** is like a nickname for a command.
-   The first command used in PowerShell is **"ls" or "list directory"**.
-   To get to PowerShell's CLI, search in your **applications list** for **"PowerShell"** and launch the program.
-   The path is not actually part of the "ls" command, but it is a command parameter.
-   **Parameters** can be thought of as a value associated with a command.
-   Listing the directories in the root of the **C drive** using **"ls"** command displays all the directories.
-   The **C drive root folder** is considered the **parent directory** and its contents are considered **child directories**.
-   Common child directories in the C drive root folder are **Program Files (x86)**, **Users**, and **Windows**.
-   The **"Get-Help ls"** command provides a brief summary of the **"ls"** command's parameters.
-   Using **"Get-Help ls -Full"** provides a more detailed help on how to use the command.
-   The **"-Force"** parameter for the **"ls"** command shows hidden and system files not normally listed with just "ls".
-   Some **important files** and directories shown by using the **"-Force"** parameter are **Recycle Bin** and **ProgramData**.
-   **Linux** has a different file system, so the process of looking around the file system would be different.
