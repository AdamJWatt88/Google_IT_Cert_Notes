-   Adding new directories in GUI is simple, **just right-click "New" and "Folder"**
-   In **PowerShell,** use the **"mkdir" (make directory)** command to add new directories
-   Use **underscores** instead of **spaces** in directory names to avoid errors
-   If you want to use spaces in directory names, surround the name with **quotes** or escape the space using the **backtick character**
-   Escaping characters is a common concept in coding, and different shells and programming languages may use different characters as escape characters
