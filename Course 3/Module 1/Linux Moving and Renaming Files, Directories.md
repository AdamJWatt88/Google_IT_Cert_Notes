-   The **"mv"** command in Linux can be used to rename and move files and directories, just like in [[Windows Moving and Renaming Files, Directories]].
-   To rename a file using "mv", specify the old file name and the new file name. For example: `mv red_document.txt blue_document.txt`
-   To move a file using "mv", specify the file name and the destination directory. For example: `mv blue_document.txt ~/Documents`
-   Wildcards can be used to move multiple files at once. For example: `mv *_document.txt ~/Desktop` will move all files with "document" in their name to the Desktop folder.
-   The **"mv"** command works the same way in Linux and Windows.
