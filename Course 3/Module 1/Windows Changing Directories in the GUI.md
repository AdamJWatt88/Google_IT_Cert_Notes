-   Directories are laid out in a specific structure
-   Changing directories is a common task in GUIs
-   In the Windows CLI, we can move between directories using commands
-   Two types of paths: absolute and relative
-   Absolute paths start from the main directory
-   Relative paths start from the current directory
-   Important to distinguish between the two when working in a shell
-   Windows CLI provides commands to navigate through directories using both types of paths.
