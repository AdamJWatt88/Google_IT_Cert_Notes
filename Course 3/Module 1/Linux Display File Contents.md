-   To read a simple file in bash, we can use the "cat" command to view the document.
	`cat document.txt`
-   However, "cat" doesn't work well for large files, so we use "less" instead.
	`less document.txt`
-   "Less" is similar to "more" in Windows but offers more functionality.
-   Common keys used to navigate "less" include up and down arrow keys, page up and page down, "G" (moves to beginning of file), "capital G" (moves to end of file), "/" (search for word or phrase), and "Q" (quit out of "less" and go back to shell).
-   "Less" is a great tool for viewing files of any size.
-   In Linux, we can use the "head" command to show the first ten lines of a file by default.
	`head document.txt`
-   The "tail" command can be used to show the last ten lines of a file by default.
	`tail document.txt`
