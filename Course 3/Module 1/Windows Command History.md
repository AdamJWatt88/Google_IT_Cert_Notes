-   **PowerShell** has a history feature that saves every command entered into memory and a special file.
-   To see the list of commands previously used, use the **"history"** command.
-   To **scroll** through the **previous commands**, use the **up** or **down arrow keys** on the keyboard.
-   To quickly reuse a command, append or modify it, instead of typing it again.
-   To **search** through previously used commands, use the **Ctrl-R** shortcut and start typing bits and pieces of the command to look for.
-   If Ctrl-R doesn't work, use the **pound symbol** followed by some part of the old command and then use tab completion to cycle through the items in the history.
-   The **clear command** can be used to clean up the shell by clearing the output on the screen. It doesn't wipe the command history.
