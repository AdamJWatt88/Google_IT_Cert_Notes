-   Bash provides **grep command** to search for words in files that **match a specific pattern.**
-  **grep command** can also be used to check if a file exists in a directory or if a word is in a file.
-   Similar to PowerShell's select bash string command, we can use grep command in Bash.
-   To **search for a word,** we can use the **grep command followed by the word** and the **file name** to search within, e.g., grep "cow" farm animals.
-   To **search through multiple files,** we can use the **asterisk wildcard command with grep**, e.g., `grep "cow" *.txt`.
-   The video shows an example where grep found the word "cow" in the text file "farm animals" and also in "ranch animals".
