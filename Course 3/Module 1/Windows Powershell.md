-   **PowerShell** is a complex and powerful command language that's super robust
-   **Common aliases** can be used that are exactly the same as their Linux counterparts
-   Advanced command line features require the use of real PowerShell commands
-   **Get-Help** is a PowerShell command used to see more information about commands
-   **Get-Alias** is a PowerShell command used to see what actual PowerShell command is executed when an alias is used
-   ls is an alias for the PowerShell command **Get-ChildItem**, which gets or lists the children (files and subdirectories) of the given item
-   Aliases for common commands are a great way to work more quickly in PowerShell
-   In Windows, there are **three different ways to execute commands**: r**eal PowerShell commands, relatable alias names, and cmd.exe commands**
-   **cmd.exe** commands are commands from the old MSDOS days of Windows and can still be run due to backwards compatibility, but they **aren't as powerful** as PowerShell commands
-   **dir** is an example of a **cmd.exe command**, which points to the PowerShell command **Get-ChildItem**, the same command that ls alias points to
-   **Get-Help** can be used **with cmd.exe** commands by using the parameter** "/?"**
-   ls "/?" wouldn't work because it's an alias for a PowerShell command, not a cmd.exe command
