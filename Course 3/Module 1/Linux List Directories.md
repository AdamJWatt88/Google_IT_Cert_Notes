-   In **Linux**, the **main directory** that all others stem from is called the **root directory** and is denoted by a **forward slash (/)**
-   The ls command can be used to list directory contents and the path of the directory can be specified after the command
-   **Important directories** under the root directory include **/bin** (essential binaries), **/etc** (system configuration files), **/home** (personal directory for users), **/proc** (information about running processes), **/usr** (user installed software), and **/var** (system logs and files that change frequently)
-   **Flags** can be used with the ls command to specify additional options and can be viewed using the **--help** flag or **man command**
-   The **-l flag** shows **detailed information** about files and folders in a long list format
-   The **-a flag** shows **all files in the directory**, including **hidden files** which are **denoted by a dot (.)**
-   Flags can be **appended together** and the order determines the order in which they are executed
-   The **ls command** can be used to view detailed information about files including **file permissions**, **number of links**, **file owner and group**, **file size**, **time stamp of last modification**, and **file or directory name**.
