-   **Files** and **folders** in operating systems are organized in a **hierarchical directory tree**.
-   The main directory holds other directories and files, and their location is called a** path**.
-   In Windows, file systems are assigned to drive letters like **C** or **D**, and each drive letter is a file system with a root directory.
-   The root directory of C is written as C, and **subdirectories** are separated by **backslashes**.
-   To **navigate to a directory** in Windows, start from the **root directory** of the drive and follow the path to the end.
-   **Hidden files** are files that are not visible by default and can be critical system files or configurations.
-   To **view hidden files**, go to the **View tab** and check the **Hidden Items checkbox**.
-   To view **information** about a file in Windows, **right-click** on it and select **Properties**.
-   The **Properties** dialog box displays **file name**, **type**, **location path**, **size**,**timestamps**, **file attributes,** and other tabs for **security**, **details**, and **previous versions**.
-   The **Details** tab shows the information displayed on the **General tab**, and the **Previous Versions** tab lets us restore an earlier version of a file.
-   The Windows GUI displays files and folders by default, and you can change the view using icons or a list.
-   The **Windows CLI** can also display file and folder information.
