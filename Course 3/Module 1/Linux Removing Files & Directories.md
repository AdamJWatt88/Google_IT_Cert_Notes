-   To remove files in Linux, use the `rm` or `remove` command.
-   Use `rm filename` to remove a file.
-   If you try to remove something you shouldn't be able to, you'll get a message.
-   Use `rm -r directoryname` to remove a directory recursively.
-   Be cautious when using the `rm` command, as it permanently deletes files and directories.
-   Always double-check that you're not removing something important by accident.
