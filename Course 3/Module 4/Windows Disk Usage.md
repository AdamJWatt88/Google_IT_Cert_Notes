-   Third-party programs are available to partition and format disks on Windows.
-   There are many applications available to check and visualize disk usage on a Windows machine.
-   The disk management console in Windows can be used to check disk capacity usage.
-   To check disk usage, open the computer management utility and head to the disk management console.
-   Right-click on the partition of interest and select properties to see the used and free space on the drive.
-   Windows provides a **command line** utility called **Disk Usage (DU)** that can print out the usage of a given disk and tell you how many files it has.
-  **DU** can be useful for creating scripts that might need **text-based output** instead of visual reports.
-   Windows provides a built-in program called **Disk Cleanup (cleanmgr.exe)** to free up space on the hard drive by deleting temporary files, compressing old and rarely used files, cleaning up logs, and emptying the recycle bin.
-  **Disk defragmentation** is a process in which files stored on a given disk are reorganized into neighboring locations to make life easier for rotating hard drive disks.
-   **Defragmentation** is **less** of a **benefit** for **solid-state drives** since there's no physical read-write head that needs to move around a spinning disk.
-   The operating system can use a process called **trim** to reclaim unused portions of the **solid-state disk**.
-   Defragmentation in Windows is handled as a scheduled task, but you can manually defragment a drive in Windows using the disk defragmenter tool.
