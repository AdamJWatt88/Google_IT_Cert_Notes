-   In Linux, software installations are more transparent than in Windows.
-   Software can be installed directly from source code, but the method varies depending on the programming language.
-   A sample package comes with a setup script, source code, and a README file.
-   The setup script contains program instructions such as compiling code into machine instructions, copying compiled binaries to /bin directory or creating a folder in /home with the user name for the package.
-   The developer decides what the software needs to work and runs tasks to get it working, including creating files or updating directories.
-   Reading the instructions yourself would require knowledge of the programming languages used.
-   This is a simplified overview of how software installation works in Linux.
