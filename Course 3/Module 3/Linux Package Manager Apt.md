-   **APT (Advanced Package Tool)** is the package manager used in **Ubuntu**.
-   APT extends package functionality and makes installation easier.
-   APT installs package dependencies, helps find packages to install, and cleans up packages not needed.
-   APT uses package repositories, which act as central storage locations for packages.
-  Ubuntu includes several repository sources by default.
-  The repository source file in Ubuntu is **/etc/apt/sources.list**
- **PPAs (Personal Package Archives)** are special repositories hosted on **Launchpad** servers
-  Launchpad is a website owned by the organization canonical limited. It allows open-source software developers to develop, maintain, and distribute software
-   **Be careful** when using PPAs as the software may not be as vetted as repositories from reputable sources.
-   Repository managers update their software regularly.
-   Use the `apt update` command to update the list of packages in repositories, and the `apt upgrade` command to install any outdated packages automatically.
-   Use the `apt --help` command to learn more about available commands.
-   Maintaining packages in Linux using APT is a crucial skill in IT support.
