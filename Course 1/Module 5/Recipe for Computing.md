- **Assembly Language** allows computer scientists to use human readable instructions, assembled to code, that the machines could understand.

- A **compiled programming language** uses human-readable instructions and sends them through a **compiler**. The compiler takes the human instructions and compiles them into machine instructions.

- **Interpreted languages** aren't compiled ahead-of-time. A file that has code written in one of these languages is usually called a script. The script is run by an interpreter which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them.
