- There are three main components to handling files handlers, the file data, metadata, and file system.

- There are lots of file systems and are used for different purposes. Some file systems support the storage of large amounts of data others only support small amounts. They can operate in different speeds and have varying resiliency towards file corruption and so on.

- For Windows, the major file system that's used is **NTFS**.**NTFS** includes many features like encryption, faster access speeds, security, and more.

- Windows is working on a new file systems call [[ReFS]] 

- For Linux, different distributions will use different file system types.

- A standard for file systems for Linux is EX T4, which is compatible with older EXT file systems.

- In general, different file system types don't play nicely with each other. You might not be able to easily move files across different file systems depending on the file system type.
