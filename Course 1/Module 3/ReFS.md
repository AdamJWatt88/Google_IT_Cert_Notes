**Resilient File System** (**ReFS**),[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS#cite_note-technetReFS1-6) codenamed "Protogon",[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS#cite_note-zdnetrefsunveiled-7) is a [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_format "Proprietary format") [file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system "File system") introduced with [Windows Server 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2012 "Windows Server 2012") with the intent of becoming the "next generation" [file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system "File system") after [NTFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS "NTFS").

ReFS was designed to overcome problems that had become significant over the years since NTFS was conceived, which are related to how data storage requirements had changed. These requirements arose from two major changes in storage systems and usage – the size of storage in use ([large or massive arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_array "Disk array") of multi-terabyte drives now being fairly common), and the need for [continual reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24/7 "24/7"). As a result, the file system needs to be self-repairing (to prevent disk checking from being impractically slow or disruptive), along with [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer "Abstraction layer") or [virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_virtualization "Storage virtualization") between physical disks and [logical volumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_volume_management "Logical volume management").

The key design advantages of ReFS include automatic [integrity checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_integrity_monitoring "File integrity monitoring") and [data scrubbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing "Data scrubbing"), elimination of the need for running [chkdsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chkdsk "Chkdsk"), protection against [data degradation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation "Data degradation"), built-in handling of [hard disk drive failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_failure "Hard disk drive failure") and [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering) "Redundancy (engineering)"), integration of [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID "RAID") functionality, a switch to [copy/allocate on write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write "Copy-on-write") for data and [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") updates, handling of [very long paths and filenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_filename "Long filename"), and [storage virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_virtualization "Storage virtualization") and [pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooling_(resource_management) "Pooling (resource management)"), including almost arbitrarily sized [logical volumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_volume "Logical volume") (unrelated to the physical sizes of the used drives).
