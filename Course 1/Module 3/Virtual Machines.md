- A virtual machine is just a copy of a real machine. 

- There are cases in IT support where we need access to a machine that isn't physically in front of us. 

- Let's say you have a Windows machine, and I want to learn another operating system like Linux, or have two separate operating systems on your disk. 

- An application like Virtual Box allows you to install Linux, and have it completely isolated from your machine. 

- Virtual machines use physical resources like memory, CPU, and storage, but they offer the added benefit of running multiple operating systems at once.
