- There are two main parts to an operating system, the kernel and the user space. 

- The kernel is the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our system's resources. 

- Kernel optimizes memory usage and make sure our applications have enough memory to run.

- The last important function that a kernel performs is input, output or IO management. This is how our kernel talks to external devices, like disks, keyboards, networks,connections, audio devices and more. IO management is anything that can give us input or that we can use for output of data.

- As users we don't interact with the kernel directly. Instead, we interact with the second part of an operating system, the user space. 

- The user space is basically made up of everything outside the kernel. 

- These are things that we interact with directly like system programs, user interfaces, etcetera. 

- When we say operating system, we're talking about both the kernel and the user space.

## Linux

- Today, Linux has become a huge community effort with developers all over the world contributing to its success. 

- Because Linux is open source lots of different organizations package their own version of it. 

- Operating systems like Windows or Macintosh, on the other hand, are solely developed by the respective companies. 

- We call these different Linux OSs distributions. 

- Some common Linux distributions are **ubuntu**, **debian** and **red hat**.
