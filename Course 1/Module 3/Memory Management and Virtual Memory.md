- When processes are run, they have to take up space in memory, so that the computer can read and load them quickly However, compared to our hard disk drives, memory comes in smaller quantities. So to give us more memory than we physically have, we use something called virtual memory.

- Virtual memory is the combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use.

- When we execute a process, we take the data of the program in chunks we call pages.

- When we store our virtual memory on our hard drive, we call the allocated space swap space.
