##  Inductive charging
- **Inductive charging** (also known as **wireless charging** or **cordless charging**) is a type of [wireless power transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer). It uses [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction") to provide electricity to portable devices. Inductive charging is also used in vehicles, power tools, electric toothbrushes, and medical devices. The portable equipment can be placed near a [charging station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station "Charging station") or inductive pad without needing to be precisely aligned or [make electrical contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_charging "Conductive charging") with a dock or plug.

- Inductive charging is named so because it transfers energy through [inductive coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_coupling "Inductive coupling"). First, [alternating current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current") passes through an [induction coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_coil "Induction coil") in the charging station or pad. The moving electric charge [creates a magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oersted%27s_law "Oersted's law"), which fluctuates in strength because the electric current's amplitude is fluctuating. This changing magnetic field [creates an alternating electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction) in the portable device's induction coil, which in turn passes through a [rectifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier "Rectifier") to convert it to [direct current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current "Direct current"). Finally, the direct current charges a [battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity) "Battery (electricity)") or provides operating power.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging#cite_note-:1-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging#cite_note-Treffers-2)

- Greater distances between sender and receiver coils can be achieved when the inductive charging system uses [resonant inductive coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_inductive_coupling "Resonant inductive coupling"), where a [capacitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor "Capacitor") is added to each induction coil to create two [LC circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit "LC circuit") with a specific resonance frequency. The frequency of the alternating current is matched with the resonance frequency, and the frequency is chosen depending on the distance desired for peak efficiency.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging#cite_note-:1-1) Recent improvements to this resonant system include using a movable transmission coil (i.e., mounted on an elevating platform or arm) and the use of other materials for the receiver coil such as [silver-plated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver "Silver") [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper "Copper") or sometimes [aluminum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium "Aluminium") to minimize weight and decrease [resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance "Electrical resistance") due to the [skin effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect "Skin effect").
