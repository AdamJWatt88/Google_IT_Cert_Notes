* Basic Input Output Services (BIOS)
* The motherboard stores the bios in a special type ofÂ memory called the read only memory chip or ROM chip.
* In today's system there's another player for bios called UEFI, which stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. UEFI performs the same function of starting your computer as a traditional BIOS, but it's more modern and has better compatibility and support for new hardware. Most hardware out there today comes with UEFI built in. Eventually, UEFI will become the predominant BIOS.
