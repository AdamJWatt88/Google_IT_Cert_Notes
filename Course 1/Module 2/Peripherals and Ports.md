- USB 2.0: Black port on the computer, 480 MBps transfer speed 

- USB 3.0: Blue port on computer, 5 Gbps transfer speed

- USB 3.1: Teal port on the computer, 10 Gbps transfer speed

- This may change depending on manufacturers.

- USB Type C can also do data transfer and power.

- **Micro USB** is a small USB port found on many non-Apple cellphones, tablets, and other portable devices. 
    
- **USB-C** is the newest reversible connector with either end having the same build. USB-C cables replace traditional USB connectors since they can carry significantly more power and transfer data at 20 Gbps.  
    
- **USB4** uses Thunderbolt 3 protocol and USB-C cables to transfer data at speeds of 40 Gbps and provide power as well. 
    
- **Lightning Port** is a connector exclusive to Apple that is similar to USB-C. It is used for charging and connecting devices to computers, external monitors, cameras and other peripherals.

-   **Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)** refers to cables transmitting voice through twisted copper pair wires. Landline telephones, dial-up internet, and alarm systems use POTS. The RJ-11 (Register Jack 11) connector is used for POTS.
    
-   **Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)** provides access to high-speed networks or the internet through telephone lines and a modem. The RJ-45 connects a computer to network elements and is mostly used with ethernet cables. 
    
-   **Cable Internet** uses a cable TV infrastructure and a modem to provide high-speed internet access to users. An F type connector is commonly used with cable modems.. 
    
-   **Fiber-optic cables** contain strands of glass fibers inside an insulated casing that send data long-distance and allow for higher-bandwidth communication. The major internet providers use fiber-optic cables for high-speed internet service.

* ***DB89** connectors are used for older peripherals like keyboards, mice, and joysticks. An IT professional may still encounter a DB89 connector for external tools a computer uses and should recognize the cable to connect to the appropriate port.

* ***Molex** connectors provide power to drives or devices inside the computer. Molex connectors are used for connecting a hard drive, disc drive (CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-ray), or a video card.

- A punch down block is a terminal strip used to connect telephone or data lines. Punch down - blocks are a quick and easy way to connect wiring. IT professionals use punch down blocks to change a wire or make a new connection for a telephone system or Local Area Network (LAN).
