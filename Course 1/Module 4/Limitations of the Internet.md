- The current protocol, Internet Protocol version four, or **IPV4**, is an address that consists of 32 bits separated into four groups. IPV4 addresses can be something like 73.55.242.3. Some IPV4 addresses are reserved for special purposes.

-   A device that wants to connect to the Internet needs to have an **IP address**. But devices around the world have already exceeded those numbers. IP addresses have been able to keep up with the amount of devices in the world thanks to **IPV6** or Internet Protocol version 6 addresses. IPV6 addresses consist of 128 bits, four times the amount that IPV4 uses, which means way more devices can have IP addresses.
    
-   An example of an IPV4 address can be something like **172.14.24.1**. But an IPV6 address can be something like **2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334**. Here's an analogy for how big this difference is between IPV4 and IPV6. With IPV6, there are 2 to the 128th power possible IP addresses.
    
-   Another mitigation tool that we've been able to use is **NAT** or **Network Address Translation**. This lets organizations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network. One task you might need to perform when you're an IT support specialist is to configure NAT on a router to facilitate communication between your company's network and the outside world.
