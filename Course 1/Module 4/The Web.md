- Once a domain name is taken it will be registered to **ICANN**,Â the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

- **DNS** acts like our internet directory. And let's just use human readable way words to map to an IP address. The computer doesn't know what Google.com is. It only knows how to get to an IP address with DNS. It's able to map Google's IP address with Google.com.

- Every time you go on a website, your computer is performing a DNS lookup to find the IP address of the website name you typed in.

- This trick can be a good first step in diagnosing certain kinds of DNS issues. So if you're able to access a website by its IP address but not its human-readable domain name, then there's a good bet that there's probably a problem somewhere in the DNS configuration your network is using.

- Understanding IP addresses can come in handy in all sorts of other situations you might encounter as an IT support specialist. The source of internet requests is usually identified by IP addresses in server logs.
