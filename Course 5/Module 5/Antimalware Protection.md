- **Anti malware defenses**: Crucial for company security in today's environment.
- **Bots, viruses, worms, and automated attacks**: Abundant on the Internet.
- **Unprotected systems**: Vulnerable when directly connected to the Internet without safeguards.
- **Critical system updates**: Necessary to mitigate threats.
- **Modern operating systems**: Have basic firewalls enabled by default, but face significant attack traffic.
- **Anti malware measures**: Essential for preventing attacks and protecting users.
- **Antivirus software**: Long-standing but may have limitations against sophisticated malware.
- **Signature-based**: Relies on a database of known malware signatures.
- **Monitoring system activity**: Antivirus software watches for behavior matching known malware signatures.
- **Blocking and quarantine**: Antivirus software attempts to block or quarantine detected malware.
- **Antivirus signatures**: Distributed by vendors to discover and address new threats.
- **Additional attack surface**: Antivirus software can be exploited by attackers.
- **Easy protection**: Antivirus software defends against common attacks.
- **Antivirus as a filter**: Removes background noise and focuses on targeted threats.
- **Defense-in-depth**: Involves multiple layers of protection, with antivirus as one piece.
- **Binary whitelisting software**: Relies on a whitelist of known good and trusted software.
- **Permitted software**: Only software on the whitelist can run, blocking everything else.
- **Defense against unknown threats**: Binary whitelisting can be effective but may inconvenience users.
- **Whitelisting based on cryptographic hashes**: Identifies unique binaries.
- **Code signing certificates**: Verify software authenticity.![[code_signing_certificate.png]]
- **Trust in specific vendors' certificates**: Whitelisting software trusts content signed with trusted certificates.
- **Increased attack surface**: Each trusted code signing certificate increases the potential for compromise.
- **Misuse of compromised certificates**: Attackers can sign malware, bypassing whitelisting defenses.
- **Risks associated with trusting certificates**: Examples of breaches highlight the importance of caution.
