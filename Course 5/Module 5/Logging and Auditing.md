- **Logging and alerting** are critical for security architecture.
- **Visibility** into security systems is necessary to assess their effectiveness.
- **Logs** of infrastructure devices and equipment need to be safeguarded and analyzed.
- **Incident investigation** skills are important for security analysis.
- Different systems and services create logs with **varying levels of detail**.
- Log information helps detect **compromise** and attacks.
- **Security information and event management systems (SIEMs)** centralize and analyze logs.
- **Normalization** is the process of converting log data into a standardized format.
- Finding the right balance in **logging information** is crucial.
- Important fields to capture in log entries include **timestamp, event/error code, service/application, user/system account, and devices involved**.
- Centralized log servers provide security benefits and aid in **forensic analysis**.
- Analyzing log details involves identifying **patterns and connections** in traffic.
- **Automated alerting** based on rules can be set up for specific events.
- **SIEM solutions** often offer **dashboards** for visualizing log data.
- **Retention policies** should be considered based on storage needs and regulatory requirements.
- Examples of logging servers and SIEM solutions include **rsyslog, Splunk Enterprise Security, IBM Security Qradar, and RSA Security Analytics**
