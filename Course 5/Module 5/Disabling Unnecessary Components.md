**Zero-day vulnerabilities**: These vulnerabilities are unique as they are unknown until they are exploited in the wild. They pose a potential risk to the security of systems and networks.

**Attack vectors**: Attack vectors are methods or mechanisms used by attackers or malware to gain access to a network or system. Examples of attack vectors include email attachments, network protocols or services, network interfaces, and user input. These represent different paths an attacker could use to compromise a system if they are able to exploit it.

**Attack surfaces**: An attack surface refers to the sum of all the different attack vectors in a given system. It encompasses all the possible ways an attacker could interact with the system, regardless of known vulnerabilities. It's important to consider all avenues through which an outside actor could potentially interact with the systems as potential attack surfaces. Keeping attack surfaces as small as possible reduces the chances of an attacker discovering unknown flaws and compromising the systems.

**Reducing attack surfaces**: As an IT support specialist, there are various approaches to reducing attack surfaces. The main idea is to simplify systems and services. The less complex something is, the lower the chances of undetected flaws. This can be achieved by disabling unnecessary services or protocols that are not essential. Every additional operating surface represents additional attack surfaces that could have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Access should only be allowed when necessary, and unnecessary access should be restricted using firewall rules.

**Simplifying software deployments**: It is beneficial to reduce the number of software solutions deployed and replace them with a unified solution whenever possible. This reduces complexity and minimizes the potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, disabling unused or unnecessary components of deployed software and systems further reduces attack surfaces.

**Extending security measures to all levels**: It is important to apply security measures not only to critical networking infrastructure and servers but also to desktop and laptop platforms used by employees. Default services and software shipped with consumer operating systems may not be needed in an enterprise network. Disabling such services and vendor-specific API access that are not required minimizes unnecessary risks and follows the defense-in-depth concept of implementing layers of security.

**Layered approach to security**: It is crucial to consider how to keep a component secure if the security systems above it fail or are bypassed. This involves planning and implementing security measures at every level of systems and networks to ensure comprehensive protection.
