1. **Detection and Containment**:
    
    - Once the threat has been **detected** and **contained**, it has to be **removed** or **remediated**.
    - When it comes to **malware infection**, this means removing the malware from affected systems.
    - In some cases, affected systems have to be **restored** to a known good configuration.
    - **Persistent malware** may resist removal, requiring careful handling during the cleanup process.
2. **Incident Containment**:
    
    - Containment strategies depend on the nature of the affected system.
    - Shutting down affected systems can prevent further damage or spread of infection.
    - Removing network access can cut off communication with the compromised system.
    - The goal is to prevent the spread of infection or remove remote access to the system.
3. **Forensic Analysis and Evidence Gathering**:
    
    - **Forensic analysis** is crucial, particularly for malware infections, to determine the attacker's actions.
    - Investigate affected machines closely by creating **disk images** for analysis without modifying original files.
    - Evidence gathering is part of the incident response process and provides valuable information for law enforcement and the security community.
4. **Legal and Public Relations Considerations**:
    
    - Involve members of the **legal team** to handle the legal implications of the incident.
    - Members of the **public relations team** should be involved to manage the impact on the company's reputation.
5. **Cleanup and Recovery**:
    
    - Use information from the analysis to prevent further intrusions or infections.
    - Determine the **entry point** and address underlying vulnerabilities concurrently with the cleanup.
    - **Postmortems** document incidents and derive lessons to prevent future occurrences.
6. **Remediation and System Restoration**:
    
    - Remediation can be complex for critical system compromises, involving auditing logs and scrutinizing systems.
    - It may be necessary to **rebuild** the system from scratch depending on the severity of the compromise.
    - Clean up involves **restoring from a backup** to a known good configuration and restoring infected or corrupted system files.
7. **Vulnerability Closure and Testing**:
    
    - Determine the attacker's access point and close the vulnerability to prevent future attacks.
    - Thoroughly **test systems** to ensure proper functionality has been restored.
    - Maintain close **monitoring and logging** on affected systems to detect any missed signs of intrusion or repeat attacks.
8. **Lessons Learned and Security Defense**:
    
    - Incorporate incident learnings into overall **security defenses**.
    - Update **firewall rules** and ACLs based on exposure discovered during the investigation.
    - Create new definitions and rules for **intrusion detection systems** to detect signs of similar attacks.
    - Stay **vigilant and prepared** to protect systems from future attacks, acknowledging that security breaches can occur.

Note: These detailed notes provide an overview of incident handling and recovery processes, highlighting key considerations at each stage. However, it's important to tailor the approach to specific organizational needs and seek expert guidance when implementing incident response plans.
