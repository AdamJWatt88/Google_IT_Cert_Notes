- **Security**: Determine risks and design defenses to minimize the impact of an attack.
- **Security risk assessment**: Starts with **threat modeling** to identify likely threats and assign priorities based on severity and probability.
- **High-value targets**: Identify and explore possible **attack vectors** to gain access to high-value assets.
- **High-value data**: Prioritize protection for user data and payment information.
- **Regular vulnerability scanning**: Crucial to identify vulnerabilities on systems and networks.
- **Vulnerability scanners**: Examples include **Nessus**, **OpenVAS**, and **Qualys**, which perform periodic scans to find hosts and discover services and versions.
- **Vulnerability report**: Provides detailed information on identified vulnerabilities, including **recommendations for mitigation**.
- **Vulnerability prioritization**: Based on **severity** and **likelihood of exploitation**.
- **Misconfigured services**, **backdoors**, and other potential risks can be detected through vulnerability scanning.
- **Up-to-date vulnerability database**: Essential for effective vulnerability detection.
- **Penetration testing**: Simulates the perspective of an attacker, attempting to break into a system or network.
- **Detection and alerting systems**: Tested during penetration testing to ensure proper functioning.
- **Identification of weak points** and **blind spots**: Helps guide future security projects.
- **In-house security teams** or **third-party companies**: Can conduct penetration testing.
- **Multiple perspectives**: Conducting both vulnerability scanning and penetration testing enhances overall security.
