- **Incident handling** is important to understand and prevent future incidents.
- The first step is **detecting the incident**, which can be done through intrusion detection systems or reports from employees or external sources.
- After detection, the incident needs to be **analyzed** to determine the effects and scope of damage.
- **Monitoring** and understanding the **baseline** of normal traffic and system behavior are crucial for detecting subtle or unusual incidents.
- **Correlating data** from different systems can provide a bigger picture of the incident and reveal the attacker's actions and access points.
- Once the scope is determined, **containment** is necessary to prevent further damage and limit the incident's spread.
- **Containment strategies** depend on the nature of the incident, such as changing passwords, revoking authentication tokens, quarantining infected machines, or adjusting firewall rules.![[quarantine-machine.png]]
- Efforts should be made to **preserve logs** and forensic evidence to aid in the investigation and identify the attacker's activities.
- Determining the **severity, impact, and recovery ability** of the incident is essential.
- **Severity** considers the number of compromised systems and the impact on business functions.
- **Impact** is assessed based on the visible and direct consequences of the incident on the organization.
- **Data exfiltration** is a significant concern, as attackers may attempt to steal sensitive data for various purposes.
- The **recovery ability** depends on the actions taken during the incident and the complexity and time required for recovery.
- Some incidents can be easily recovered by **restoring from backups**, while others may result in irreversible data loss or extensive damage to critical infrastructure systems.
- It's important to note that incident handling requires a **proactive and comprehensive approach** to minimize the impact and prevent future incidents.
