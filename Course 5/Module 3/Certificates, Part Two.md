- Certificates are public keys signed by a certificate authority (CA) as a trust indicator.
- TLS server certificates and client certificates exist, with client certificates used by clients for authentication and verification by servers.
- IT support specialists should understand client certificates and certificate-based authentication for troubleshooting purposes.
- Client certificates are commonly used in VPN systems and enterprise Wi-Fi setups for authentication.
- Organizations must establish and maintain CA infrastructure to issue and sign client certificates.
- Certificate authentication involves mutual authentication, where the client authenticates the server.
- Clients using certificate authentication need to have the **CA certificate** in their trust store to establish trust.
- **Certificate authentication** is like presenting identification at the airport to prove identity.
- The ID is checked for issuer trust, similar to a certificate signed by a trusted CA.
- Certificate authentication verifies **two dates**: "**not valid before**" and "**not valid after.**"
- "Not valid before" checks if the certificate is valid yet, while "not valid after" denotes the expiration date.
- Certificates may be revoked, and revocation is checked against a revocation list or certificate revocation list (CRL) published by the CA.
- Possession of the corresponding private key is necessary to prove ownership of the certificate.
- The private key possession is verified through a challenge-response mechanism.
- The server requests data to be signed using the private key, proving possession and preventing impersonation.
- The challenge-response mechanism is similar to the airport checking the photo on an ID to prevent impersonation.
