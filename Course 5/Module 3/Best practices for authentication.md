- **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Accounting** (the three A's of security) are important concepts in the field of security.
- **Authentication** is the process of proving one's identity, while identification refers to describing an entity uniquely.
- **Authentication** is necessary to ensure that individuals are who they claim to be. It involves providing credentials, such as a username and password, to verify identity.
- **Authorization** determines the resources and privileges that an authenticated identity has access to. It restricts access to specific individuals or entities.
- **Authentication** is often abbreviated as "**authn**," while **authorization** is abbreviated as "**authz**."
- A **strong password is crucial** for ensuring the security of an account. A weak password, such as "ponies," is easily breakable through brute force or dictionary-based attacks.
- A strong password is longer, more complex, and includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- However, there is often a trade-off between security and usability. While a complex password is more secure, it can be challenging to remember.
- Risk mitigation is a key aspect of security. It involves understanding and reducing risks while monitoring them effectively.
- Extreme security measures, such as isolating a computer system in an underground bunker, may provide high security but render the system useless.
- Balancing security and usability is essential. Finding a reasonably secure password that is also memorable is important.
- Password policies are crucial for organizations to ensure strong passwords and good password hygiene.
- A good password policy includes length requirements, character complexity, and checks for the presence of dictionary words.
- **Passwords should never be written down, reused across accounts, or shared with others.**
- **Password rotation**, changing passwords at regular intervals, is recommended to safeguard against potential compromise.
- However, the **password rotation period should not be too short,** as it may lead to poor security behavior, such as writing down passwords.
- The inconvenience caused by frequent password changes may result in users adopting insecure practices.
