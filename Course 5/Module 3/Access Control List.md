- An **Access Control List (ACL)** is a mechanism used to define permissions or authorizations for objects, commonly encountered in file system permissions and network security.
- In the context of file systems, an ACL is a table or database that contains a list of entries specifying access rights for individuals or groups for various objects like folders, files, or programs.
- **Access Control Entries (ACEs)** are individual entries within the ACL that define permissions for specific objects.
- **ACEs determine whether a user or group has read, write, or execute permissions for the associated object**.
- ACLs provide granular control over access to objects, allowing different levels of permissions for different users or groups.
- In network security, ACLs are widely used to apply access controls to routers, switches, and firewalls.
- Network ACLs are used to restrict and control access to services running on hosts within a network.
- Network ACLs can be configured for incoming and outgoing traffic, allowing or blocking specific types of communication.
- They can also be used to limit external access to systems and enforce policies, as well as prevent unauthorized outbound data transfers.

Overall, ACLs are essential for managing access permissions in both file systems and network security, enabling administrators to control who can access specific objects and what actions
