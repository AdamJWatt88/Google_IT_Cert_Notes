- **TACACS+** is an **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) protocol** developed by Cisco. It stands for **Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus**.
- It was released as an open standard in 1993 and serves as an upgrade to the older TACACS protocol developed in 1984 for MILNET (the unclassified network for **DARPA**), which later became **ARPANET**.
- TACACS+ replaced **X-TACACS (extended TACACS)**, which was a Cisco proprietary extension built on top of TACACS.
- The primary use of TACACS+ is for device administration, providing authentication, authorization, and accounting capabilities. In contrast, **RADIUS** is predominantly used for network access AAA.
- TACACS+ focuses more on the authorization and accounting aspects, while authentication is generally similar to other AAA protocols.
- Although encountering a TACACS+ implementation may not be common in an IT support career, it is essential to be aware of its existence.
- TACACS+ is **commonly employed as an authentication system for network infrastructure** devices, which are often targeted by attackers due to their high value.
- As an organization grows and its network infrastructure expands, considering the implementation of TACACS+ could enhance security and access control.
