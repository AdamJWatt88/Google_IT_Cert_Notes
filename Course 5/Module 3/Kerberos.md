- **Kerberos** is a network authentication protocol that enables entities to prove their identity over potentially insecure channels, providing mutual authentication.
- It utilizes tickets and symmetric encryption to protect protocol messages from eavesdropping and replay attacks.
- The name "Kerberos" is inspired by the Greek mythical character, a three-headed guard dog protecting the gates to the underworld, which aligns with the purpose of an authentication protocol.
- Kerberos was initially developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1980s (version 4) and later published as version 5 in 1993.
- Kerberos supports **AES** encryption and implements checksums to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Windows 2000 and newer versions**, when joined to a Windows Domain, **use Kerberos** as the default authentication protocol.
- Microsoft has implemented their own version of the Kerberos service with some modifications, including the addition of the **RC4 stream cipher**.
- **Tickets** are **tokens** that prove a user's identity within the Kerberos realm and can be used for authentication to services protected by Kerberos.
- **Authentication tickets** allow users to authenticate to services without requiring individual username and password authentication for each service.
- Tickets have an expiration time but can be automatically renewed transparently.
- **The Kerberos protocol operates as follows**:
    1. The user enters their username and password on their client machine.
    2. The Kerberos client software generates a symmetric encryption key from the password.
    3. The client sends a plaintext message to the Kerberos AS (Authentication Server) with the user ID.
    4. The AS verifies the user ID against an authentication database (e.g., Active Directory).
    5. The AS encrypts and sends a message to the client with the client TGS session key and a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT).
    6. The client can now authenticate with the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) using the TGT.
    7. The client sends a message to the TGS with the encrypted TGT and the service name or ID it wants to access.
    8. The TGS decrypts the TGT, obtains the client TGS session key, and checks the client ID.
    9. If authenticated, the TGS sends two messages back to the client: the Client-Server Ticket and the client-server session key.
    10. The client can now authenticate itself to the Service Server (SS) using the Client-Server Ticket.
    11. The client sends messages to the SS with the encrypted Client-Server Ticket and a new authenticator.
    12. The SS decrypts the message, compares the client ID, and if successful, grants access to the requested service.
- **Kerberos** has been criticized for being a **single monolithic service**, which creates a single point of failure and potential impersonation if compromised.
- It requires strict time synchronization between client and server clocks, usually achieved using **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**.
- The trust model of Kerberos requires established trust between clients, services, and the Kerberos server, making it challenging to authenticate from unknown or untrusted clients.
- **Kerberos authentication is commonly encountered in environments using Microsoft Active Directory**, and understanding the underlying protocol helps when troubleshooting related issues.
