-   **Asymmetric** or **public key ciphers** are the **second class** of ciphers.
-   **Symmetric** ciphers use the **same key** for **encryption** and **decryption**.
-   **Asymmetric** encryption uses **different keys** for encryption and decryption.
-   An example of sending messages back and forth with asymmetric encryption would go like this: 
	-   Two people, Suzanne and Darryl, want to communicate securely using asymmetric encryption.
	-   They each generate a private key, which is used to derive a public key.
	-   Public keys are shared publicly, while private keys must be kept secret.
	-   Suzanne uses Darryl's public key to encrypt a message, and Darryl uses his private key to decrypt it.
	-   Only Darryl's private key can decrypt messages encrypted with Darryl's public key.
	-   The same applies to Suzanne's key pairs.
	-   Darryl can reply by using Suzanne's public key to encrypt his message.
	-   Asymmetric encryption provides confidentiality and authenticity.
	-   Public key signatures are another function of the system.
	-   Suzanne can generate a digital signature using her private key to ensure message origin and integrity.
	-   Darryl can verify the signature using Suzanne's public key.
	-   If the message was not tampered with, the signature will validate.
-   **Asymmetric cryptography** provides **confidentiality**, **authenticity**, and **non-repudiation**.
-   **Confidentiality** is achieved through encryption and decryption.
-   **Authenticity** is achieved through digital signatures.
-   **Non-repudiation** ensures the message's author cannot deny its origin.
