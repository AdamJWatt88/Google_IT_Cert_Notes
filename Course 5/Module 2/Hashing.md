-   **Hashing** is a type of function or operation used in computing, especially within security.
-   A hash function takes an arbitrary data input and maps it to an output of a fixed size called a hash or digest.
-   The output size is specified in bits and remains the same regardless of the input size.
-   Hash functions ensure that different inputs produce unique outputs to identify data uniquely.
-   Hash functions have various applications, including hash tables for data lookups, duplicate detection, and data integrity.
-   **Cryptographic** hash functions are specifically used for authentication, message integrity, fingerprinting, data corruption detection, and digital signatures.
-   Cryptographic hash functions are one-way functions, meaning the plaintext cannot be recovered from the hash.
-    Ideal cryptographic hash functions are deterministic, quick to compute, irreversible, and resistant to collisions.
-   Hash collisions occur when two different inputs produce the same hash output.
-   Cryptographic hash functions operate on blocks of data, similar to symmetric key block ciphers.
-   Many popular hash functions are based on modified block ciphers.
-   A basic example demonstrates how a hash function takes an input string and generates a unique hash digest.
-   A real hash function example is **md5sum**, which generates a unique hash digest for different input strings.
-   Hash functions are essential for ensuring data integrity and providing a reliable means of data identification and verification.
