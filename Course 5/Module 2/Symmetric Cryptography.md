-   Cryptographic systems involve encryption and decryption of messages.
-   **Symmetric key algorithms** use the same key for both **encryption** and **decryption**.
-   The key in a symmetric key algorithm must be kept secret.
-   **Substitution ciphers** replace parts of plaintext with ciphertext using a key.
-   The **Caesar cipher** is a well-known substitution cipher that shifts characters in the alphabet.
-   **ROT13** is a variant of the Caesar cipher that r**otates the alphabet by 13 places**.
-   Symmetric key ciphers can be categorized as **block ciphers** or **stream ciphers**.
-   **Stream ciphers** encrypt data one character or digit at a time, while **block ciphers** encrypt fixed-size blocks.
-   Stream ciphers are generally **faster** but can be **less secure** if key reuse occurs.
-   **Initialization vector (IV)** is used to avoid key reuse in stream ciphers.
-   IV is combined with the encryption key to generate a one-time encryption key.
-   The IV must be sent in plaintext along with the encrypted message for decryption.
-   IVs are commonly used in protocols like 802.11 for wireless encryption.
