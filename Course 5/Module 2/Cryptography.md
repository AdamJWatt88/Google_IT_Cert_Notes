-   **Cryptography** is the practice of hiding messages from potential enemies.
-   **Encryption** involves converting plaintext into unreadable ciphertext using a cipher.
-   **Decryption** is the reverse process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
-   **Ciphers** consist of encryption algorithms and keys.
-   **Encryption** algorithms are complex mathematical operations used in the conversion process.
-   **Keys** introduce uniqueness and secrecy to the cipher.
-   Security through obscurity is not a reliable method of encryption.
-   **Kerckhoff**'s principle states that a **cryptosystem** should remain secure even if the algorithm is known, except for the key.
-   **Cryptography** is the discipline that covers the practice of coding and hiding messages.
-   **Cryptology** is the study of cryptography.
-   **Cryptanalysis** is the process of deciphering coded messages or finding hidden messages.
-   Frequency analysis is a method of cryptanalysis that studies the frequency of letters in **ciphertext**.
-   Cryptography and cryptanalysis played a significant role in World War I and World War II.
-   Automation and the development of computers greatly advanced cryptanalysis.
-   **Steganography** is the practice of hiding information without encoding it.
-   Steganographic techniques involve **embedding messages or files within other files.**
-   Modern steganography includes hiding messages in images or videos.
-   Learning about cryptography and related practices can be exciting and engaging.
