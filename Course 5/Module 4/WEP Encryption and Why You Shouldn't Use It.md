Lesson Topic: Wireless Security Implementation for IT Support Specialists

1. **Introduction to Wireless Security Implementation**

- IT support specialists are responsible for Wi-Fi configuration and infrastructure, making understanding wireless security options crucial.
- This lesson focuses on the available security implementations for wireless networks.

2. **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**

- **WEP** was the first security protocol introduced in the 802.11 standard in 1997.
- Its purpose was to provide privacy equivalent to wired networks by encrypting wireless traffic.
- **WEP used the RC4 symmetric stream cipher for encryption.**
- Encryption keys were derived from a shared key of either 40-bit or 104-bit, along with a 24-bit initialization vector (IV).![[WEP.png]]
- WEP authentication supported **two modes**: **open system authentication** and **shared key authentication**.
- **Shared key authentication** used a challenge-response process, exposing both plaintext and ciphertext, making it insecure.![[WEP_shared_key.png]]
- **WEP's weakness was primarily due to the reuse of IVs and the predictable encryption key generation, making it easily susceptible to attacks**.
- **WEP is outdated, and its use is strongly discouraged due to its vulnerabilities.**

3. **Importance of Understanding WEP**

- IT support specialists may encounter **legacy systems still using WEP.**
- Understanding the security implications of WEP helps prioritize upgrading to more secure protocols.

Note: As an IT support specialist, it is crucial to promote the use of modern and secure wireless security protocols, such as **WPA2** or **WPA3**, and advise against the use of **WEP** due to its significant vulnerabilities.
