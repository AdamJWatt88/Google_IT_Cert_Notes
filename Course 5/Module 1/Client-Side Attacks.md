-   Injection attacks are a common type of security exploit in software development and on the web.
-  **Injection attacks** involve the injection of malicious code into a system.
-   Analogous to injecting a car's gas tank with a non-gas substance, injection attacks can cause damage.
-   Injection attacks can be mitigated by implementing mechanisms that validate input and sanitize data.
-   **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** attacks are a type of injection attack where the attacker targets the user of a service.
-   XSS attacks can lead to session hijacking by embedding malicious scripts in a website.
-   **SQL injection attacks** target the entire website if it uses a SQL database.
-   SQL injection attacks involve running SQL commands to manipulate and access website data.
-   Proper software development principles can help prevent injection attacks.
-   XSS and SQL injection attacks can have severe consequences if not addressed.
