-   **Brute force attacks** involve trying various combinations of characters and letters until the correct password is found.
-   Brute force attacks can be time-consuming due to the large number of password combinations.
-   **Captchas** are used to differentiate between humans and automated systems, preventing automated password attacks.
-  **Dictionary attacks** involve trying common words and passwords instead of brute force combinations.
-   Strong passwords are crucial for preventing password attacks.
-   Strong passwords should avoid using real words and include a mix of capitals, letters, and symbols.
